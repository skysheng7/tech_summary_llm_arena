You are an expert evaluator assessing the quality of technical research paper summaries. You will be given:
1. The original technical research paper (or relevant sections)
2. The original prompt that was used to generate the summary: "Can you provide a summary of this article in 5 sentences?"
3. A summary to evaluate

Evaluate the summary on the following criteria using the specified scoring rubric (each item is on a 0-10 point scale):

**Research Question (0-10 point scale)**
Example: 
- 10: Clearly articulates the research question
- 5: There are multiple research questions, but not all research questions are mentioned
- 0: Did not mention what is the research question / misinterprets it

**Factual Accuracy (0-10 point scale)**
Example: 
- 10: All numerical results (e.g., exact p values) are correctly summarized from the original paper
- 5: A few minor mistakes with some numerical results
- 0: Most numerical results are not correctly summarized from the original paper

**Terminology Explanation and Coherence (0-10 point scale)**
Example:
- 10: The summary is easy to understand. Terminologies are explained clearly when they are used
- 5: Some terminologies are not easy to understand and lack explanation. But overall not many terminologies are used, or most are explained when being used
- 0: Used many terminologies without explanation

**Prompt Following (0, 5, or 10 points)**
Example:
- 10: If the original prompt asked for n sentence summary (e.g., 5 sentence summary), the summary text actually generated the output in exactly n sentences
- 5: There are slightly more or less sentences than what is requested in the original prompt
- 0: The output did not follow the original prompt's instructions at all

**Completeness and Relevance (0, 5, or 10 points)**
Example:
- 10: The summary correctly covers the most important take home messages from the paper
- 5: Covers some important points but misses or underemphasizes key contributions or overemphasizes one point
- 0: The summary is vague, too general, or the key points it summarized are not the actual most important key points from the paper

**Hallucination (0, 5, or 10 points)**
Example:
- 10: All statements are directly supported by the paper
- 5: The summary makes claims that are not present in the paper, which are plausible but not supported within the paper
- 0: Major hallucination, fabricates summary in results, methods, conclusions or in key points made by the paper

**IMPORTANT**: You can score each criterion with any value between 0 and 10.

  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": <0-10>,
    "reasoning": "<brief explanation, note what's missing or overemphasized if applicable>"
  },
  "hallucination": {

    "reasoning": "<brief explanation, cite specific unsupported claims if applicable>"
  },
  "total_score": <sum of all scores, max 60>,
