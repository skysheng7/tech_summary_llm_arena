  "quality": "Excellent",
  "summary": "The article proposes a closed testing procedure for updating clinical prediction models when applying them to new populations. The procedure selects the best method from three update methods of increasing complexity: recalibration in the large, recalibration, and model revision.",
  "strengths": [
    "A systematic approach to selecting the best method for updating prediction models",
    "The procedure prevents overfitting in small samples by selecting simpler methods unless strong evidence supports more complex updates",
    "Three clinical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the procedure"
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "No discussion on how to handle missing values or outliers in the data",
    "Lack of consideration for potential biases in the data or update methods",
    "The procedure assumes that the underlying model is correct, which may not always be the case"
  ]
