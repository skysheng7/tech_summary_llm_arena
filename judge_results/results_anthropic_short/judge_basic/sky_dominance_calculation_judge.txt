{
"text": "This study investigated how dominance hierarchies in dairy cows change with varying levels of competition at feeding areas, measured by feeder occupancy, over a 10-month period with 159 cows.",
"sentences": 1
},
{
"text": "As feeder occupancy increased (indicating higher competition), the dominance hierarchy became flatter, with hierarchy steepness decreasing by 2.41 × 10⁻³ for each 1% rise in feeder occupancy.",
"sentences": 1
},
{
"text": "During high competition, there was a 0.13% increase in two-way dyads (where both cows replaced each other) per 1% feeder occupancy increase, and 7.57% more dyads showed previously dominant individuals losing proportionally more interactions.",
"sentences": 1
},
{
"text": "The authors suggest that during heightened competition, cows' high valuation of fresh feed can override intrinsic dominance attributes, leading subordinate animals to be more successful in challenging dominant individuals.",
"sentences": 1
},
{
"text": "The researchers advise against calculating dominance hierarchies based solely on agonistic interactions during high competition periods and emphasize the importance of considering context when constructing dominance hierarchies.",
