  "summary": "# Summary of \"Fast unfolding of communities in large networks\"\r\n\r\nThis paper by Blondel et al. introduces a fast, heuristic algorithm for detecting community structure in large networks through modularity optimization.\r\nThe method works in two iterative phases: first optimizing modularity by moving individual nodes between communities, then aggregating communities into meta-networks for subsequent passes.\r\nThe algorithm demonstrates exceptional computational efficiency, analyzing networks up to 118 million nodes in just 152 minutes, vastly outperforming previous methods limited to networks under 5 million nodes.\r\nThe approach naturally reveals hierarchical community structure at multiple resolutions and was validated on a Belgian mobile phone network of 2.6 million users, successfully identifying linguistically homogeneous communities separated by French and Dutch speakers.\r\nThe algorithm achieves both superior speed (linear complexity on sparse networks) and higher modularity values compared to existing community detection methods."
