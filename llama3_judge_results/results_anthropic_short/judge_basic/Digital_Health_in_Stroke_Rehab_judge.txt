  "summary": "# Summary of \"Digital Health Technology for Stroke Rehabilitation in Canada: A Scoping Review\"\n\nThis scoping review examined how Digital Health Technologies (DHTs) are used in stroke rehabilitation across Canada by analyzing 14 studies published between 2010-2022. The findings showed that most research focused on upper extremity rehabilitation (85.71%) during the chronic phase of stroke (64.3%), primarily in home settings (50%), using technologies like sensors, virtual reality, gaming systems, telerehabilitation, and robotics.\n\nStudies demonstrated that these technologies are feasible and effective in improving motor function, patient engagement, and quality of life, with key facilitators including user motivation, clinician support, and technology performance, while barriers included technical challenges, user inexperience, and limited device portability. However, significant gaps were identified, including limited research on lower extremity function, cognition, activities of daily living, mental health, and the acute/subacute phases of stroke recovery.\n\nThe authors recommend that future Canadian research should prioritize high-quality randomized controlled trials, expand beyond upper extremity outcomes, address earlier phases of stroke recovery, and ensure equitable access for culturally diverse and rural populations to advance the integration of DHTs into clinical practice.",
