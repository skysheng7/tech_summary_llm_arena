## Summary of the paper (Curr J Neurol, 2022; 21(2):125–132)

### Purpose
This systematic review examined whether **wearable robotic gloves** used as rehabilitation tools can **improve hand function in people after stroke**, and assessed the quality and limitations of the available clinical evidence.

### Background
- Hand impairment is very common after stroke (the paper cites ~75%).
- Effective hand rehabilitation typically requires **repetitive, intensive, task-specific practice**.
- Wearable robotic gloves are attractive because they are generally **lighter, more portable, and more suitable for home use** than larger clinic-based robotic machines or rigid exoskeletons.

### Methods
- Databases searched up to **September 2021**: PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE, and Google Scholar.
- Inclusion criteria: human stroke participants, use of a **wearable robotic glove**, therapeutic intervention targeting hand motor recovery/function, and relevant functional/motor outcomes.
- Study quality assessed using **12 selected items** from the Downs and Black checklist.
- Because studies were few and outcomes varied, results were summarized **descriptively** (no meta-analysis).

### Results
- From **2674 records**, only **5 studies** met inclusion criteria.
- Participants: mostly **subacute or chronic stroke**, small samples (**3 to 13** participants per study), ages **21–84**.
- Devices studied (one per study):  
  - **EPHO** (EMG-controlled power hand orthosis)  
  - **PneuGlove** (pneumatic finger extension assist)  
  - **X-Glove** (actuated glove with modes for stretching/active training)  
  - **HandinMind (HiM)** soft robotic glove system  
  - **IronHand** soft robotic glove (grip assistance for daily activities)
- Intervention dose: typically **4–6 weeks**, either 3 sessions/week or a specified minutes/week dosage; approaches included **task-oriented training** and/or **games/virtual reality plus real-object practice**.
- Outcomes used included common stroke upper-limb measures such as **Fugl-Meyer**, **ARAT**, **WMFT**, **Box and Block Test**, **Motor Activity Log**, and **Jebsen-Taylor**.
- **All included studies reported improvements** in hand/upper-limb function after glove-based interventions.

### Methodological quality
- Quality scores ranged **7–10 out of 12** (modified Downs & Black).
- Major evidence limitations:
  - **No randomized controlled trials (RCTs)**
  - **No control groups** in the included experimental studies
  - **No sample size/power calculations**
  - Small samples and limited generalizability

### Key discussion points / gaps identified
- Clinical evidence is **promising but weak** due to study design and small samples.
- Most studies focused on **finger extension**; less is known about gloves that train/assist **flexion** or combined movements in a therapeutic trial context.
- Effects are unclear for patients with **more severe spasticity**, since many studies included only mild–moderate (or unspecified) spasticity.
- No standard exists for **optimal intervention timing, dosage, or setting** (virtual vs real-world tasks), making comparisons difficult.

### Conclusion
Wearable robotic gloves **may improve hand function after stroke**, but the current evidence base is limited and lacks high-level trials. The authors call for **larger, better-designed studies (ideally RCTs)** with clearer patient selection criteria, standardized protocols, and comparisons to conventional therapy to confirm effectiveness and determine best practices.
