Blondel, Guillaume, Lambiotte, and Lefebvre (2008) introduce a very fast heuristic for detecting communities in large graphs by **optimizing modularity**. The paper’s key contribution is an algorithm that scales to networks with **tens to hundreds of millions of nodes**, where the main practical limitation becomes **memory**, not computation time.

## Core idea (the “Louvain” method)
The algorithm repeatedly alternates two phases (a “pass”):

1. **Local modularity improvement (node moves):**  
   Start with each node in its own community. Then, for each node, consider moving it into the community of each neighbor and compute the **modularity gain**. Move the node to the neighbor community that yields the largest positive gain. Repeat until no single-node move improves modularity (a local optimum).

2. **Community aggregation (graph coarsening):**  
   Build a new weighted graph where each node represents a community found in phase 1. Edge weights between new nodes equal the sum of weights between the corresponding communities; intra-community edges become **self-loops**. Then run phase 1 again on this smaller graph.

These passes produce a **hierarchy of community structure** (communities, communities-of-communities, etc.) and usually converge in **fewer than ~5 passes**.

## Why it’s fast
- The modularity change from moving a node can be computed efficiently using local quantities (community internal weight, total incident weight, node degree/strength).
- The graph shrinks sharply after the first pass, so most runtime is in early iterations.
- Empirically, runtime is close to **linear** in typical sparse networks.

## Results and comparisons
The authors compare against several well-known modularity/community methods (e.g., Clauset–Newman–Moore greedy, Pons–Latapy, Wakita–Tsurumi). Their method generally achieves:
- **Higher modularity** (better partitions by that metric)
- **Much lower computation time**

They report large-scale runs including:
- A **Belgian mobile phone network** (~2.6M nodes, ~6.3M links): found communities strongly aligned with Belgium’s **French/Dutch linguistic split**; most large communities are highly linguistically homogeneous.
- Very large **web graphs**: up to **118M nodes and >1B links**, processed in about **152 minutes** on their hardware.

## Accuracy on benchmarks and hierarchy
On synthetic benchmarks with known planted communities, performance is competitive with strong methods, though the very best accuracy is sometimes achieved by much slower approaches (e.g., simulated annealing). The multi-pass nature also yields meaningful **intermediate resolutions**, partially addressing concerns like modularity’s **resolution limit** by letting users inspect different hierarchy levels.

## Takeaway
The paper proposes a simple, practical, and extremely scalable modularity-optimization heuristic—now widely known as the **Louvain community detection algorithm**—that enables community detection on networks far larger than prior methods, while also producing a useful multi-level (hierarchical) decomposition.
