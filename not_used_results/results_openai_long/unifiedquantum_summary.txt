## High-level summary

This paper studies what kinds of **quantum state transformations are fundamentally impossible (“no-go theorems”)** due to the **linearity/superposition principle**, and what becomes possible when inputs are restricted to **special sets of states** (especially **finite, linearly independent sets**) and when **probabilistic (post-selected) operations** are allowed.

It contributes three main threads:

1. **New unified no-go theorems** (generalizing no-cloning, no-deleting, and no-superposing).
2. **A unified framework for probabilistic “one-shot” cloning/deleting with controllable errors** on finite sets, characterized by linear independence and accompanied by success-probability bounds.
3. **New constructions for superposing unknown states** when inputs are restricted (finite sets or “fixed-overlap”-type conditions, possibly using multiple copies).

## 1) New no-go results: “No-encoding” and unified no-go theorems

### No-encoding theorem (Theorem 1)
The paper proves a “no-encoding” (or “no-superpose-with-a-fixed-state”) theorem:

- Given an **unknown pure state** \(|\psi\rangle\) and a **fixed** pure state \(|\phi\rangle\) in a **finite-dimensional** Hilbert space,
- there is **no universal completely positive (CP) map** (even allowing postselection) that, for all \(|\psi\rangle\), outputs the normalized superposition
\[
|\varphi\rangle \propto \alpha|\psi\rangle + \beta|\phi\rangle
\]
with nonzero success probability (for nontrivial \(\alpha,\beta\)).

Intuition: if such a map existed, applying it to different decompositions and using linearity forces contradictions (essentially, it would “encode” unknown quantum information into a controlled linear combination with a fixed state, which linear quantum mechanics forbids universally in finite dimension).

### Unified generalizations (Theorems 2 and 3)
The paper then extends this into broader families of forbidden maps that include:

- **No-cloning** (e.g., trying to map \(k\) copies to \(n>k\) copies).
- **No-deleting** (e.g., mapping \(k\) copies down to fewer copies by unitary-only deletion).
- **No-superposing** (universal creation of superpositions of unknown states).

These theorems show that many apparently different impossibility statements share a common root: **linearity combined with global phase invariance**. A key proof trick is: because \(|\psi\rangle\) and \(e^{i\theta}|\psi\rangle\) represent the same physical state, a purported universal map must behave consistently under global phases; demanding that consistency often forces parameters (like \(\beta\)) to be zero, contradicting the task definition.

## 2) What becomes possible on restricted inputs: unified probabilistic cloning/deleting with errors

The paper switches from “universal over all states” to **restricted families** of states.

### Central theme: linear independence characterizes possibility
For a **finite set** of pure states \(\{|\psi_1\rangle,\dots,|\psi_m\rangle\}\), the paper gives a unified transformation framework in which:

- If these states are **linearly independent**, then there exist **probabilistic CP maps** (implemented via unitary + ancilla + measurement/postselection) that can:
  - clone them perfectly (probabilistically),
  - delete copies (in the sense of earlier probabilistic deleting schemes),
  - and more generally produce outputs of the form
\[
|\varphi_{i,j}\rangle \propto \alpha_{ij}|\psi_i\rangle^{\otimes j} + \beta_{ij}|\Phi_{ij}\rangle
\]
where the “error term” \(|\Phi_{ij}\rangle\) is **known and independent of the input**.

This is presented as a **single “one-shot” scheme** that unifies perfect and imperfect cloning/deleting as special cases by choosing parameters (\(\beta=0\) yields perfect-copy branches, etc.).

### Success probability bounds
The paper derives **upper bounds** on achievable success probabilities using:

- matrix analysis tools (Hadamard/Schur products, Gram matrices),
- operator norm inequalities,
- and state-distance metrics.

The bounds generalize earlier probabilistic cloning bounds and connect the achievable efficiencies to geometric/algebraic properties of the input set (notably the Gram matrix and its Hadamard powers).

## 3) Superposing unknown states under restrictions

### Superposition from a finite set (Theorem 6)
A key constructive result:

- If \(\{|\psi_i\rangle\}\) is a **finite linearly independent set**, then there exists a probabilistic CP map that, given \(|\psi_i\rangle|\psi_j\rangle\), outputs
\[
|\varphi_{ij}\rangle \propto \alpha_{ij}|\psi_i\rangle + \beta_{ij}|\psi_j\rangle
\]
for all \(i,j\) in the set.

So: **universal superposition is impossible**, but **superposition becomes possible on finite, linearly independent families** (probabilistically).

### Superposition with multiple copies and overlap-type conditions (Theorems 8–9)
The paper also generalizes earlier “fixed overlap with a known state” constructions (like Oszmaniec et al.):

- Using multiple copies of \(|\psi\rangle\) and \(|\phi\rangle\) plus a known reference state \(|X\rangle\),
- and assuming certain nonzero overlap conditions involving permutations of the copies,
- one can probabilistically create a controlled superposition
\[
|\varphi\rangle \propto \alpha e^{i\theta_1}|\psi\rangle + \beta e^{i\theta_2}|\phi\rangle
\]
where the phases are determined by overlaps with \(|X\rangle\).

This is then extended to:
- \(k\) copies,
- and even superposing **more than two** states (an \(n\)-term superposition) under analogous structured-overlap conditions.

## Takeaway

- **Universally** (for arbitrary unknown states in finite dimension), tasks like “clone,” “delete,” and “create a specified superposition with a fixed state” are **forbidden** by linearity—this paper packages them into broader unified impossibility statements.
- **On restricted sets**, especially **finite linearly independent** collections, many of these tasks become **probabilistically achievable**, and the paper provides **unified constructions** and **general success-probability bounds**.
- It also expands the toolkit for **superposing unknown states** when extra structure is available (finite sets, multiple copies, and reference-overlap conditions).

If you tell me what level you want (1-page overview vs. detailed theorem-by-theorem), I can produce a more targeted summary or a “map” of which theorems imply which classic no-go results.
