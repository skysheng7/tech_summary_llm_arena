Here is the summary converted into bullet points:

*   DeBERTNeXT is a pre-trained language model that can be fine-tuned for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including fake news detection.
*   The authors propose a multimodal approach to detect fake news.
*   This multimodal approach combines text and visual features.
*   It uses a combination of transformer-based models.
*   The proposed DeBERTNeXT architecture consists of three main components: a textual input module, a visual input module, and a fusion module that combines the output of both modules.
*   Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the Fakeddit dataset.
