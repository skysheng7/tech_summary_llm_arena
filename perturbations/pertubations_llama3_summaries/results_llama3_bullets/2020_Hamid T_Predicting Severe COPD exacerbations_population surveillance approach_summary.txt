Here is the summary converted into bullet points:

*   Researchers developed a machine learning model to predict severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations.
*   The model was based on administrative health data.
*   It incorporated 14 variables, including demographic information, comorbidities, and medical treatments.
*   The model showed good performance in a validation dataset, with a precision-recall curve indicating accurate predictions at different cutoff levels.
*   The model outperformed a reference model that only used historical exacerbation data as a predictor.
*   This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning approaches for predicting COPD exacerbations and improving healthcare outcomes.
