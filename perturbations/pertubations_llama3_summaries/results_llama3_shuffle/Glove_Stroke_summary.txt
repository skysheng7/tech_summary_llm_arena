Here is a summary of the article in 5 sentences, reordered:

The article discusses the effectiveness of robotic gloves in improving hand function in stroke patients. A review of existing studies found that robotic gloves have been shown to be beneficial in terms of increasing hand movement and strength, as well as reducing spasticity. However, there is limited evidence on the long-term effects of these devices and more research is needed to determine their feasibility and effectiveness in clinical settings. The authors also highlight the need for standardization of outcome measures and reporting of methodological quality in future studies. Overall, the article suggests that robotic gloves have potential as a treatment option for stroke patients with hand impairments, but further investigation is required to fully understand their benefits and limitations.
