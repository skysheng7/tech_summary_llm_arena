Here are the sentences reordered. Since the original provided only two distinct sentences, there's only one way to reorder them that maintains the core meaning and flow.

1. Unfortunately, the article you provided does not appear to be a single, coherent piece of writing that can be summarized in 5 sentences.
2. The text appears to be a collection of references, citations, and hyperlinks, likely from a research paper or academic publication.

If you would like, I can try to summarize the overall topic or theme of the article, but it may not be possible to condense the content into just 5 sentences given its format and content.
