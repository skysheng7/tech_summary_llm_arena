Here is a summary of the article in 5 sentences:

The authors used observational studies and mathematical models to investigate the effects of competition on dominance hierarchies. The article discusses how increased competition can flatten dominance hierarchies, particularly in social animals like dairy cattle. They found that as competition increases, dominant individuals tend to lose their advantage, leading to a more equal distribution of resources among group members. This flattening of the hierarchy can have positive effects, such as improved welfare for all animals in the group. However, it can also lead to increased aggression and stress, particularly if the group is not well-managed or provided with adequate resources.
