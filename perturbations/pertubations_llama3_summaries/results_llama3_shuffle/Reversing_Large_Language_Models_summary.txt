Here is a summary of the article in 5 sentences:

The article proposes a new approach to training large language models (LLMs) called Reversible Large Language Models (REVERSING LLMS). This approach uses reversible neural networks, which allow for efficient computation and memory usage. They also introduce a lightweight fine-tuning procedure that converts existing checkpoints into fully reversible models using only two epochs of auxiliary data. The authors demonstrate that their method matches or slightly surpasses the perplexity and zero-shot accuracy of non-reversible baselines on several benchmark datasets. Overall, the article presents a promising solution for efficient training and fine-tuning of large language models.
