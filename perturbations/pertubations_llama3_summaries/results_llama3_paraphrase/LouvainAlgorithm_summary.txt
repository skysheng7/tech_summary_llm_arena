This article introduces a novel algorithm designed for identifying communities within extensive networks, capable of revealing layered community organizations. The proposed method, termed the "CNM" (Community Detection Algorithm), employs a sequential strategy. Initially, it groups nodes into communities based on their interconnections. Subsequently, it optimizes these communities through a process of repeated merging or splitting to achieve maximal modularity. The efficacy of this algorithm is validated by its application to various network types, such as a social network and an Erdős-Rényi random graph. Furthermore, the research illustrates the algorithm's capacity to uncover hierarchical community structures, a prevalent characteristic of numerous intricate networks. In conclusion, the CNM algorithm offers a swift and effective solution for community detection in large networks, demonstrating both high accuracy and good scalability.
