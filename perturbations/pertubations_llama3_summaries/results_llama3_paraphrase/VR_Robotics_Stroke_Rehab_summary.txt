Here's a paraphrased summary using different wording and sentence structure, while retaining all the original information:

This article investigates the application of robotic training employing virtual reality for the rehabilitation of lower limb impairments in stroke survivors. The research sought to determine how effective this particular training regimen is in enhancing balance, walking ability, and the performance of everyday tasks for individuals in the subacute phase of stroke recovery. The findings indicated that the virtual reality-enhanced robotic training led to significant improvements in balance, gait, and daily activities for stroke patients when contrasted with conventional physical therapy methods. The research emphasizes the prospective advantages of integrating virtual reality technology to bolster rehabilitation results for those affected by stroke. Ultimately, the conclusions propose that robotic training utilizing virtual reality could serve as a beneficial supplement to standard physical therapy, thereby improving the functional capabilities and overall well-being of stroke patients.
