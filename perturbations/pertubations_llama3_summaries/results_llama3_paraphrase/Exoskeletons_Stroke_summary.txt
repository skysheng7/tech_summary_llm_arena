Here are five sentences paraphrasing the provided summary:

This article provides a comprehensive review of studies that integrate exoskeletons with virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and gamification for stroke patient rehabilitation. The review's objective is to compile the current research findings concerning the efficacy of these technologies in enhancing motor skills, cognitive abilities, and patient involvement throughout the rehabilitation process. Findings indicate that a majority of the examined studies documented improvements in motor function, while some also noted advancements in cognitive function and patient engagement. The review also addresses shortcomings identified in the studies, such as limited participant numbers, brief observation periods following treatment, and inconsistencies in how results were measured. In conclusion, the review underscores the promising advantages of employing VR, AR, and gamification to boost stroke rehabilitation results, while simultaneously stressing the necessity for additional investigation with larger and more varied participant populations.
