Here's a paraphrased version of the summary, maintaining the original information and sentence count:

A novel algorithm was created and tested to forecast serious flare-ups of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This predictive tool was built with information from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and then evaluated using an independent data set. The research indicated that the algorithm demonstrated strong capabilities in anticipating severe exacerbations, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.87. Furthermore, the algorithm exhibited satisfactory calibration and discrimination metrics.
