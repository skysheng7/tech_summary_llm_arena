This particular research study has delved into the realm of using collaborative efforts from a crowd of individuals, a technique commonly referred to as crowdsourcing, in conjunction with sophisticated computational methods known as machine learning algorithms. The primary objective of this investigation was to explore and determine how these two powerful tools could be effectively employed for the crucial task of assessing and identifying lameness, a condition that affects dairy cattle. In order to facilitate this assessment process, the dedicated researchers were instrumental in the creation and development of a digital platform, specifically designed to be accessible via the internet and hence, a web-based platform. This innovative platform was carefully constructed to enable individuals, who were participants in the study, to observe video recordings depicting various dairy cows. Following their observations, these participants were then tasked with assigning a rating to each cow, indicating the perceived severity of their lameness, and this rating was to be done in accordance with a set of pre-established and clearly defined criteria that had been put in place by the researchers. The findings that emerged from this extensive evaluation revealed a rather interesting and significant trend: while the accuracy of lameness assessments made by any single individual rater, when considered in isolation, was observed to be quite low, the act of combining and aggregating the ratings provided by a substantial and numerous group of people led to a remarkably high level of overall accuracy. Consequently, this method, which involves the collective input of many individuals, possesses the distinct capability and considerable potential to be developed into a system that is not only dependable and resilient, but also capable of expanding in scope and size, thereby creating a robust and scalable system that is exceptionally well-suited for the precise detection of lameness in dairy cattle, a problem that carries significant implications for the well-being and ethical treatment of these animals, and is thus an important welfare issue. Furthermore, in addition to its practical applications in lameness detection, this insightful study also serves to underscore and draw attention to the broader and promising applications that can be realized through the synergistic utilization of both crowdsourcing techniques and the advanced capabilities of machine learning in the critical domain of animal welfare assessments in general.
