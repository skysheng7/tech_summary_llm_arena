Here are several paraphrased versions of the summary, each with different wording and sentence structure while retaining all original information:

**Version 1 (Focus on the technologies and findings):**

A comprehensive systematic review was conducted to investigate how exoskeletons are utilized alongside virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), or gamified elements for the rehabilitation of stroke patients. The research indicated that these integrated technologies hold potential for enhancing motor capabilities and boosting patient involvement. Although a significant portion of the studies concentrated on rehabilitation of the upper limbs, a clear deficiency was observed in research concerning lower limb applications and therapies conducted in the home environment. The review also pointed out a requirement for more adaptable games and a deeper exploration of AR's capabilities in this domain. In conclusion, the article underscores the increasing importance of interactive technologies in stroke rehabilitation and the obstacles encountered when moving these treatments to a home-based context.

**Version 2 (Emphasizing the benefits and limitations):**

The combined application of exoskeletons with virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), or gamification for stroke patient rehabilitation was the subject of this systematic review. The findings suggest that these blended technologies offer promising avenues for enhancing motor function and elevating patient engagement. A significant observation was the disparity in research focus, with many studies addressing upper limb rehabilitation but a notable absence of work on lower limb applications and home-based rehabilitation. Furthermore, the review identified a need for more personalized game design and a greater investigation into the potential of AR in this therapeutic area. Ultimately, the article sheds light on the expanding influence of interactive technologies in stroke rehabilitation and the difficulties associated with implementing these therapies at home.

**Version 3 (More concise and direct):**

Investigating exoskeletons alongside VR, AR, or gamification for stroke rehabilitation, this systematic review revealed promising improvements in motor function and patient engagement. While many studies targeted upper limb recovery, research gaps exist for lower limb applications and home-based settings. The review highlighted the need for more tailored games and exploration of AR's role. Ultimately, the article emphasizes the growing impact of interactive technologies in stroke rehabilitation and the challenges of home implementation.

**Version 4 (Starting with the purpose):**

To assess the use of exoskeletons in conjunction with virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), or gamification for stroke patient rehabilitation, a systematic review was performed. This examination demonstrated that these combined technologies show potential for improving motor function and increasing patient engagement. A key finding was the heavy concentration of studies on upper limb rehabilitation, while research into lower limb applications and home-based rehabilitation remains a significant gap. The review also identified a demand for more customizable games and further investigation into AR's possibilities in this field. In essence, the article underlines the expanding presence of interactive technologies in stroke rehabilitation and the hurdles in transferring these treatments to home environments.
