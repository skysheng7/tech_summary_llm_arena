Here are several paraphrased versions of the summary, each with different wording and sentence structure while retaining all original information:

**Option 1:**

A comprehensive analysis of wearable robotic gloves for stroke patients sought to determine their impact on hand function. After an initial review of 2674 articles, only 5 studies were deemed suitable for inclusion. Despite their moderate methodological rigor, these select studies indicated that using wearable robotic gloves yields beneficial therapeutic outcomes for hand function. Nevertheless, the review highlighted certain shortcomings, including limited participant numbers, the absence of comparison groups, and inconsistencies in how the interventions were applied. Consequently, the authors stress the importance of conducting more extensive research with larger participant pools and uniform research approaches to solidify the effectiveness of these technologies.

**Option 2:**

Investigating the therapeutic potential of wearable robotic gloves for enhancing hand function in individuals recovering from stroke, this systematic review examined a substantial body of literature. From a pool of 2674 articles, five studies ultimately met the established selection criteria. These studies, characterized by a moderate level of methodological quality, collectively found that wearable robotic gloves demonstrate a positive therapeutic influence on hand function. However, the review pointed out several constraints, such as small participant cohorts, a lack of control groups for comparison, and diverse intervention strategies. Therefore, the review underscores the necessity for more robust studies employing larger sample sizes and consistent methodological frameworks to validate the efficacy of these devices.

**Option 3:**

The therapeutic benefits of wearable robotic gloves in restoring hand function for stroke survivors were explored in this systematic review. A total of 2674 articles were initially screened, with only 5 studies ultimately satisfying the inclusion criteria. Although these included studies possessed moderate methodological quality, their findings indicated a positive therapeutic impact of wearable robotic gloves on hand function. The review also identified limitations such as restricted participant numbers, the absence of control groups, and variations in intervention protocols. Accordingly, the review emphasizes the need for more thorough research with larger sample sizes and standardized methodologies to confirm the effectiveness of these assistive devices.

**Option 4:**

This systematic review focused on the therapeutic outcomes of wearable robotic gloves designed to improve hand function in stroke patients. Out of 2674 articles assessed, a mere 5 studies fulfilled the necessary inclusion criteria. These studies, while of moderate methodological quality, arrived at the conclusion that wearable robotic gloves exert a beneficial therapeutic effect on hand function. Nonetheless, the review recognized limitations, including small study populations, a lack of control groups, and disparate intervention approaches. Thus, the review argues for the necessity of more comprehensive research with expanded sample sizes and standardized research methods to substantiate the efficacy of these devices.
