A comprehensive review examined how digital health technologies (DHTs) have been employed for stroke recovery in Canada from 2010 to 2022. Researchers analyzed 14 studies, which predominantly concentrated on improving upper limb function during the chronic stage post-stroke. Frequently utilized technologies included virtual reality, gaming consoles, and mobile or sensor-driven exercises. The core conclusions revealed that DHTs are practical and successful, leading to better patient results and presenting an opportunity to circumvent accessibility issues, particularly for those in remote regions. Nevertheless, for these technologies to be widely adopted, obstacles such as technical shortcomings, unfamiliarity among users, and insufficient clinician engagement must be overcome. Moving forward, Canadian investigations should focus on robust randomized controlled trials, expand their scope of assessment beyond upper extremity function, and explore the application of DHTs in earlier stages of stroke recovery, while also taking into account diverse demographic groups.
