To enhance the efficiency and precision of quantum energy estimation algorithms in quantum chemistry simulations, this study presents a thorough method for generating superior initial states on quantum computers. The researchers have developed a novel metric, termed the energy distribution, to evaluate the caliber of these states. They also outline a complete algorithm encompassing state preparation, quality evaluation, and subsequent improvement. Furthermore, they introduce an efficient quantum algorithm for constructing states as summations of Slater determinants, alongside an innovative technique for approximating energy distributions. The paper emphasizes how this methodology can pinpoint "Goldilocks problems" – scenarios where quantum advantage is most probable – and validates its utility with numerical demonstrations on diverse molecular systems. In essence, this research tackles a significant hurdle in quantum chemistry by offering the means to acquire dependable initial states for quantum computing applications.
