Employing short video recordings, this research investigates a participatory approach to evaluating lameness in dairy cows. Through Amazon Mechanical Turk, individuals without prior experience in animal assessment were engaged to watch side-by-side cow video comparisons and assign scores for their comparative lameness. Findings demonstrate that this crowdsourcing strategy, upon aggregating individual responses, yields a high degree of concordance with expert evaluations. This suggests its viability as a dependable and economical means of assessing lameness. Furthermore, the research determined that approximately 10 crowd workers per assessment task are adequate for achieving reliable results. This technique offers the possibility of creating extensive datasets for the development of automated lameness detection systems, potentially enabling earlier identification and enhanced management of lameness within commercial cattle populations.
