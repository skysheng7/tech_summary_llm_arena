This extensive investigation delved deeply into the intricate relationship between varying degrees of competition and the resultant structures of dominance hierarchies within herds of dairy cows. The core discovery of this research highlights a discernible trend: as the level of competition for essential feed resources escalated, a direct consequence observed was a marked flattening of the established dominance hierarchy. This phenomenon of hierarchy flattening was meticulously detailed, revealing a crucial shift in the dynamics of social interactions.

Specifically, the researchers observed that under conditions of heightened competition, subordinate cows, who would typically be at a disadvantage in less competitive environments, demonstrated an increased capacity to successfully challenge their more dominant counterparts. This enhanced ability of subordinate animals to assert themselves led to a greater prevalence of what the study terms "2-way dyads." These specific types of social interactions are characterized by a situation where, over a series of encounters, both animals involved in the dyad managed to achieve a victory against the other, a pattern that deviates from the clear wins and losses typically seen in more stable, less competitive hierarchies.

The implications of these findings are significant, as the study posits that during periods of elevated competition, the perceived value and importance of the scarce resource – in this case, feed – can exert a powerful influence that effectively overshadows or overrides the inherent, intrinsic attributes that normally define an animal's dominance status. In essence, when resources are scarce and highly valued, a cow's motivation to secure that resource can empower her to overcome natural dominance tendencies. Consequently, the researchers strongly advise that when one seeks to understand or evaluate the dominance hierarchies present within dairy cow populations, it is absolutely imperative to take into full consideration the prevailing context of competition. The level of competition is not a static factor but a dynamic one that profoundly shapes how dominance relationships manifest and operate. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment necessitates an understanding of whether the cows are operating within an environment of low, moderate, or high competition, as this contextual factor is a critical determinant of the observed hierarchical structure and individual success within it.
