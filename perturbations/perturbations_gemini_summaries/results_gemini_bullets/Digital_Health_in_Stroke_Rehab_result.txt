Here's the summary converted into bullet points:

*   This scoping review explored the use of digital health technologies (DHTs) for stroke rehabilitation in Canada.
*   The review covered the period between 2010 and 2022.
*   14 studies were identified.
*   The studies primarily focused on upper extremity function.
*   The chronic phase of stroke was the main focus.
*   Common technologies included virtual reality, gaming systems, and mobile/sensor-based training.
*   Key findings indicate that DHTs are feasible.
*   Key findings indicate that DHTs are effective.
*   DHTs improve patient outcomes.
*   DHTs offer potential to overcome access barriers.
*   This is especially relevant in rural areas.
*   Challenges for widespread adoption include technical limitations.
*   Challenges for widespread adoption include user inexperience.
*   Challenges for widespread adoption include a lack of clinician involvement.
*   Future Canadian research should prioritize high-quality RCTs.
*   Future Canadian research should broaden outcome targets beyond UE function.
*   Future Canadian research should investigate DHT use in earlier stroke phases.
*   Future Canadian research should consider diverse populations.
