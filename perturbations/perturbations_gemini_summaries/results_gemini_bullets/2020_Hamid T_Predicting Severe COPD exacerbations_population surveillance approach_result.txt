Here's the summary converted into bullet points:

*   This study explored the use of administrative health data to predict severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbations.
*   Researchers developed and evaluated several machine-learning algorithms.
*   Gradient boosting showed the highest accuracy (AUC of 0.82) in predicting hospitalizations within two months.
*   This approach significantly outperformed the current standard of care, which relies solely on prior exacerbation history.
*   The findings suggest that administrative data can effectively identify high-risk COPD patients for targeted preventive interventions.
*   The study proposes that this population surveillance method can improve patient outcomes and potentially reduce healthcare costs.
