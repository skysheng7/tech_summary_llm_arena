Here's the reordered summary with the sentences in a logical flow:

1. This study investigated how competition levels affect dominance hierarchies in dairy cows.
2. Researchers found that as competition for feed increased (indicated by higher feeder occupancy), the dominance hierarchy became flatter.
3. This flattening occurred because subordinate cows became more successful in challenging dominant cows, leading to more "2-way dyads" where both animals won interactions against each other.
4. The study suggests that during high competition, resource valuation can override intrinsic dominance attributes, influencing competitive success.
5. Therefore, it is recommended to consider the context of competition when assessing dominance hierarchies in dairy cows.
