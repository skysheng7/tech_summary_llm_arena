Here's the reordered summary:

This study explores a crowdsourced method for assessing lameness in dairy cattle using short video clips. Non-experienced crowd workers were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk to compare videos of cows walking side-by-side and rate their relative lameness. The study also found that as few as 10 crowd workers per task are sufficient to obtain reliable assessments. The results indicate that this crowdsourcing approach, when responses are averaged, achieves high agreement with experienced assessors, suggesting it's a reliable and cost-effective way to assess lameness. This method has the potential to generate large datasets for training automated lameness detection algorithms and could lead to earlier detection and improved management of lameness in commercial herds.
