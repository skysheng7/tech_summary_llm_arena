Here is the reordered summary:

This article investigates how generative AI models, specifically OpenAI's DALL-E 3, present a biased and romanticized view of livestock farming by erasing the realities of intensive farming practices. The study found that DALL-E 3, through its automatic prompt revision process, consistently generated pastoral images of cows grazing and pigs in mud, even when explicitly asked for realistic depictions. Disabling this prompt revision revealed that the base model could generate more accurate, indoor-focused images reflecting modern intensive farming, suggesting the bias is introduced through the revision mechanism. This romanticized portrayal risks reinforcing misinformation about animal agriculture, hindering meaningful dialogue about animal welfare and the social sustainability of farming. The authors recommend AI transparency policies, disclosure of prompt revision, and more representative image generation to address this issue.
