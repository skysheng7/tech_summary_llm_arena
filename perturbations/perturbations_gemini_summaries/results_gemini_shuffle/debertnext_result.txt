Here's the reordered summary:

This paper introduces DeBERTNeXT, a multimodal framework for detecting fake news by combining textual and visual information. The model utilizes pre-trained DeBERTa V3 for text and ConvNeXT Large for images, with their features being concatenated and fed into a classification layer. Experiments on the Fakeddit, Politifact, and Gossipcop datasets show that DeBERTNeXT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and other metrics. The authors highlight the challenges of multimodal fusion and the need for efficient models to handle the growing volume of fake news. Future work may involve incorporating additional modalities like audio and video for a more comprehensive fake news detection system.
