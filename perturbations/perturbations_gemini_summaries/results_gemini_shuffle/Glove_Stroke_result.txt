Out of 2674 articles screened, only 5 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies, though of moderate methodological quality, concluded that wearable robotic gloves have a positive therapeutic effect on hand function. However, limitations such as small sample sizes, lack of control groups, and varying intervention protocols were identified. This systematic review investigates the therapeutic effects of wearable robotic gloves on improving hand function in stroke patients. The review emphasizes the need for more comprehensive studies with larger sample sizes and standardized methodologies to confirm the efficacy of these devices.
