This paper introduces a novel multiscale framework for efficiently training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The approach addresses the computational and memory challenges faced by standard GNN training on large graphs by leveraging hierarchical graph representations and subgraphs. The proposed methods include coarse-to-fine learning, subgraph-to-full-graph transfer, and multiscale gradient computation, all aimed at reducing computational overhead without sacrificing predictive performance. Experiments on various datasets and tasks demonstrate that this multiscale training can significantly accelerate GNN training for large-scale problems. The authors conclude that their method is versatile and adaptable to different GNN architectures, datasets, and pooling techniques.
