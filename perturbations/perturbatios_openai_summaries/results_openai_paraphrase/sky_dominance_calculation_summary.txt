Here's a paraphrase of the summary, maintaining all information while altering wording and sentence structure:

Over a ten-month period, researchers continuously collected sensor data from a fluid group of dairy cows (comprising 48 individuals at any given time, with 159 participating in total) to investigate if inferred dominance hierarchies, based on feeder "replacement" occurrences, are affected by varying levels of competition. Feeder occupancy, measured in real-time, was used to quantify competition, and distinct Elo-based hierarchies were established for each of the 25 analyzed occupancy levels. The findings revealed a consistent trend of decreasing hierarchy steepness, meaning the hierarchy became less pronounced or "flatter," as feeder occupancy escalated. This increased occupancy also led to a greater proportion of dyads exhibiting two-way interactions (where either cow could displace the other), signifying more frequent reversals and less stable dominance relationships. At the most crowded feeding conditions, a larger number of dyads showed the cow initially identified as dominant (at low occupancy) experiencing more significant losses, with the dominant cow's success rate further diminishing as occupancy levels rose. Consequently, the researchers determined that intense competition, likely coupled with high feed desirability, can supersede inherent dominance traits. Therefore, they suggest that dominance hierarchies established solely during periods of peak competition, such as immediately after fresh feed is provided, could be deceptive and necessitate consideration of their specific environmental context.
