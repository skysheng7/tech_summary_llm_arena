Here's a paraphrased version of the summary, using different wording and sentence structure while retaining all original information:

A systematic review, conducted between 2010 and 2017, analyzed research investigating the integration of exoskeleton or robotic devices with virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), or gamification techniques for poststroke rehabilitation. The objective was to enhance motor function and participation.

Employing PRISMA guidelines for searches across the MEDLINE, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library databases, the researchers identified 30 studies, encompassing approximately 385 individuals. These studies included both randomized trials and initial exploratory designs.

The majority of the interventions focused on the upper limb (28 out of 30 studies) and were implemented within clinical environments (25 out of 30 studies). The interfaces were equally divided between VR-based and game-based approaches, with no studies identified that combined AR with stroke-exoskeleton rehabilitation within the selected literature.

Despite variations in study designs and the outcome measures used (such as the Fugl-Meyer assessment, Wolf Motor Function Test, and Modified Ashworth Scale), the review observed generally favorable enhancements in motor function and participant engagement when VR or game elements were incorporated into exoskeleton therapy.

The researchers concluded that these technologies hold potential for facilitating the transition of rehabilitation from clinical settings to home environments. However, they highlighted the necessity for increased research into home-based applications and the development of more sophisticated, customizable "serious games" designed to maintain motivation and utility beyond the clinic.
