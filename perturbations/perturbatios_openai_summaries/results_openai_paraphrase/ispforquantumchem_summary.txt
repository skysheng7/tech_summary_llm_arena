This research outlines a comprehensive process for generating excellent starting points for quantum chemistry's energy estimation algorithms, highlighting the significant impact of initial state quality on the overall duration of the computation. A novel and actionable measure of quality is introduced: the state's **energy distribution** across the Hamiltonian's eigenvalues. The paper then details both classical and quantum techniques—including series expansions, a resolvent/Green's-function methodology, and basic Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) sampling—to estimate this distribution without prior knowledge of the exact ground state. For practical application, the researchers have engineered a more efficient fault-tolerant algorithm for loading **sums of Slater determinants**, achieving a Toffoli complexity of \(O(D\log D)\), a notable improvement compared to previous \(O(ND)\)-class methods. Furthermore, they have assessed the computational expenses involved in preparing **matrix product states**. The authors suggest employing **low-precision (coarse) QPE followed by postselection** as an economical "refinement" stage. This technique serves to eliminate high-energy components and to detect/address QPE "leakage" (erroneous low-energy results stemming from kernel tail effects). Experimental results obtained from studies on hydrogen chains, stretched N\(_2\), Cr\(_2\), and Fe\(_4\)S\(_4\) demonstrate that superior initial states—frequently derived from DMRG/SHCI and occasionally compressed—can slash the total energy estimation cost by several orders of magnitude. These improved initial states also aid in identifying scenarios where quantum advantage is most likely to occur.
