This article examines OpenAI's DALL-E 3's portrayal of intensive livestock operations. Researchers discovered that the AI's automated prompt refinement process frequently idealizes dairy and pig farms by incorporating idyllic, outdoor elements into its generated images. This tendency persisted even when users specifically asked for "typical" or "accurate" representations of prevalent dairy and pig farming practices. Instead of showing the indoor confinement common in industrialized nations, the model predominantly generated scenes of animals on pastures or in mud.

However, when the authors employed a method to circumvent prompt revision, the resulting images significantly shifted towards depictions of animals in confined indoor settings, such as cows at feeding stations or pigs behind metal barriers on concrete floors. Default regional prompts (North America, Europe, Oceania) also yielded predominantly pastoral imagery. Yet, when prompt revision was disabled, the model began to show some country-specific variations in its outputs that partially reflected actual animal housing patterns.

The researchers contend that this concealed prompt rewriting capability can effectively obscure uncomfortable truths and promote inaccurate information. Consequently, they advocate for increased openness and verifiability regarding prompt revision mechanisms, along with features that allow users to view or disable these revisions.
