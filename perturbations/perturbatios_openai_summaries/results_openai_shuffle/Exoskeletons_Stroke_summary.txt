Here is the reordered summary:

This systematic review examined studies from 2010–2017 on poststroke rehabilitation that combined exoskeleton/robotic devices with virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), or gamification to improve motor function and participation. Using PRISMA-guided searches across MEDLINE, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, and the Cochrane Library, the authors included 30 studies (about 385 participants) spanning randomized trials and exploratory designs. Most interventions targeted the upper limb (28/30), were conducted in clinical settings (25/30), and split evenly between VR-based and game-based interfaces, with no AR-based stroke-exoskeleton studies identified in the included sample. Across the heterogeneous studies and outcome measures (eg, Fugl-Meyer, WMFT, MAS), the review found generally positive improvements in motor function and engagement when VR or game elements were paired with exoskeleton therapy. The authors conclude that these technologies could help bridge clinic-to-home rehabilitation, but emphasize the need for more home-based studies and better-designed customizable “serious games” to sustain motivation and usability outside the clinic.
