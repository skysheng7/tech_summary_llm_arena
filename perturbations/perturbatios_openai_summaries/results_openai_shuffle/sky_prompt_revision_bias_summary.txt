Here's the reordered summary, maintaining the original sentence content:

The article investigates how OpenAI’s DALL‑E 3 depicts intensive livestock farming and finds that its automatic prompt revision tends to “romanticize” dairy and pig farms by adding pastoral details that lead to outdoor, idyllic imagery. Even when users explicitly request “typical” or “accurate” depictions of what most dairy and pig farms look like, the model still produces mostly pasture/mud scenes that conflict with common modern practices in industrialized countries where animals are largely housed indoors. When the authors used a workaround intended to inhibit prompt revision, the generated images shifted substantially toward indoor confinement scenes (e.g., cows at feed barriers/headlocks, pigs behind metal railings on concrete). Regional prompts (North America, Europe, Oceania) produced similarly pastoral outputs by default, but with prompt revision suppressed, some country-level differences emerged that partially tracked real-world housing patterns. The authors argue this hidden rewriting can systematically erase controversial realities and reinforce mis- or disinformation, and they recommend greater transparency and auditability of prompt revision plus options for users to see or disable it.
