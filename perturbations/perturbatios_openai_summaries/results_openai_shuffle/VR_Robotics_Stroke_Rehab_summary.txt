Here is the reordered summary with the original sentences:

This pilot assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial tested whether fully immersive virtual reality (VR) combined with a lower-limb rehabilitation robot could improve recovery in stroke patients with hemiplegia. Forty-two patients were randomized to either VR-based robotic training plus conventional rehabilitation or conventional rehabilitation alone for 4 weeks (30 minutes/day, 5 days/week), and 40 completed the study. The VR-robot group showed significantly greater improvement in lower-limb motor function (FMA-LE change 6.5 vs 3.3; p<0.001) and also had better balance (BBS), walking ability (FAC), activities of daily living (Barthel Index), and stroke-specific quality of life (all p<0.05). Global cognitive function (MoCA) improved within both groups but did not differ between groups (p=0.873). No adverse events were reported, and the authors conclude the approach is feasible and promising but needs larger, longer-term trials to confirm effectiveness and practicality.
