Here's a rewritten summary that restates ideas and adds redundant explanations, without introducing new facts:

This research explores a novel method for evaluating lameness in dairy cows. The approach is specifically designed to be remote, meaning it doesn't require on-site physical examination of the animals. Furthermore, it's a comparison-based system, focusing on relative assessments rather than absolute scores. The core of this method involves presenting video footage of cows in motion. Specifically, two videos of walking cows are displayed simultaneously, side-by-side, for observation. Online crowd workers are then tasked with viewing these paired videos and making judgments. Their assignment is to determine which of the two cows depicted in the videos exhibits a greater degree of lameness. Not only do they identify the more lame cow, but they are also asked to quantify the difference in lameness severity, using a scoring scale that ranges from -3 (indicating the first cow is significantly more lame) to +3 (indicating the second cow is significantly more lame).

The study involved a substantial number of participants. A total of fifty crowd workers were engaged to complete each of the eleven distinct short tasks that comprised the study. Each of these eleven tasks consisted of ten pairs of videos to be evaluated. The data generated by these crowd workers was subsequently compared against the assessments made by a group of five highly experienced professionals who are recognized experts in the field of lameness assessment in cattle.

Upon analysis of the collected data, it was observed that individual crowd workers displayed a moderate level of agreement among themselves. This means that while individual workers had some commonality in their judgments, there was also variability. However, when the ratings from multiple crowd workers were aggregated and averaged for each task, a much stronger concordance emerged. This averaged crowd rating demonstrated a very close alignment with the average rating provided by the expert assessors. This close agreement was evident across a total of 88 distinct comparisons that were tested. The statistical measure used to quantify this agreement, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), revealed values in the range of approximately 0.89 to 0.91, indicating a high degree of reliability between the crowd-averaged results and the expert evaluations. The researchers also investigated whether further refinement of the crowd data through methods like filtering or clustering would enhance this agreement. They discovered that these additional data processing steps did not lead to any meaningful improvement in the already strong agreement between the crowd ratings and the expert ratings.

A significant finding from the study was the determination of the optimal number of crowd workers needed to achieve robust results. The authors found that by averaging the assessments of approximately ten crowd workers for each task, it was sufficient to achieve a strong level of agreement with the expert assessments, with the ICC values consistently exceeding 0.80. Furthermore, they observed that increasing the number of crowd workers beyond this approximate threshold of ten per task yielded diminishing returns, with little to no significant improvement in the agreement with experts.

Based on these findings, the authors put forth a conclusion that this crowdsourced approach, utilizing pairwise video comparisons, offers a promising solution. They propose that this method can serve as a swift and cost-effective means of estimating the prevalence and severity of lameness within dairy herds. Moreover, they highlight its potential utility in the creation of extensive labeled datasets. Such datasets are crucial for the development and training of automated computer-vision systems that are designed to detect lameness in cows, thereby offering a scalable and objective
