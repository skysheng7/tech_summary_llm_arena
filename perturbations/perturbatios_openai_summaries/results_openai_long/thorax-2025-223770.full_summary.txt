Here is a longer, more redundant version of the summary, restating ideas and adding explanations without introducing new facts:

The PRECISE-X model represents a significant new development, having been meticulously created and then rigorously tested and confirmed in its ability to perform as intended. Its primary purpose is to provide an estimation of the likelihood, or risk, that a patient newly diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) will experience their very first episode of severe exacerbation. This exacerbation, specifically, is defined as one that necessitates admission to a hospital. This new model fills a crucial void in existing tools because it is designed to operate effectively even when a patient's medical history does not yet include any record of previous exacerbations. In other words, it's for individuals who are being diagnosed with COPD for the first time, and therefore have no prior exacerbation history to draw upon for risk assessment.

To achieve this predictive capability, the PRECISE-X model was developed using a substantial dataset comprising UK CPRD Aurum primary care records. This extensive collection of data spanned a considerable period, from the year 2004 all the way through to 2022, and included information on a very large number of individuals – specifically, 219,015 patients who were newly diagnosed with COPD. The model’s output is a prediction of risk, and it offers these predictions over two distinct timeframes: a primary prediction horizon of five years, and a secondary, shorter-term prediction horizon of twelve months. These risk estimations are based solely on readily available, routine clinical variables that are typically collected during standard medical consultations.

At its core, the PRECISE-X model relies on a foundational set of four predictor variables. These are considered essential and are referred to as the core predictors. They include the patient's age, their sex (male or female), their score on the Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale, which measures breathlessness, and their Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV₁), a measure of lung function. Beyond these four fundamental predictors, the model also possesses the flexibility to incorporate an additional twenty-eight optional predictor variables. This allows for a more detailed and potentially more accurate risk assessment, as these optional variables can include a variety of other relevant clinical information. Examples of these supplementary predictors include factors such as the patient's current smoking status, the presence of any existing comorbidities (other medical conditions), records of any prior hospital admissions or visits to the emergency department (ED), the level of eosinophils in the blood, and the types of inhaler therapies the patient is currently using.

The predictive performance of the PRECISE-X model was subjected to rigorous testing through internal-external cross-validation. This process involved testing the model on data from nine different regions across the United Kingdom. The results of this validation demonstrated that the model possesses strong discriminative power, meaning it is effective at distinguishing between patients who are at higher risk and those who are at lower risk. Furthermore, the model exhibited robust calibration, indicating that its predicted probabilities of an exacerbation closely align with the actual observed event rates across different risk groups. Specifically, the c-statistic, a common measure of discriminatory ability, was 0.836 for the 5-year prediction and 0.756 for the 1-year prediction. The evaluation also revealed a generally positive net
