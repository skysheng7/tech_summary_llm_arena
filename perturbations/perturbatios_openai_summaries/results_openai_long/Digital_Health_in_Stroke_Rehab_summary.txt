This comprehensive scoping review undertook a thorough examination of the landscape of digital health technologies (DHTs) as they have been applied within the context of stroke rehabilitation specifically in Canada. The primary objectives of this extensive investigation were twofold: first, to meticulously document and understand the ways in which these digital health technologies have been utilized for stroke rehabilitation in Canadian settings, and second, to comprehensively identify and articulate the existing gaps that currently hinder effective clinical practice, rigorous research endeavors, and informed policy development and decision-making processes.

To achieve these ambitious goals, the researchers employed a systematic and multi-pronged search strategy. This strategy involved extensive searches across established academic databases, ensuring a broad capture of published research, as well as a diligent exploration of the grey literature. The grey literature, which includes materials not formally published through traditional channels, was crucial for providing a more complete picture of the current state of affairs. Through this meticulous search process, the authors successfully identified a total of 14 distinct Canadian studies that were published within the designated timeframe, spanning from the year 2010 up to and including 2022. This collection of studies represented a diverse range of research methodologies, encompassing not only qualitative studies, which delve into the experiences and perspectives of individuals, but also randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the gold standard for establishing causality and efficacy.

Upon analyzing these 14 studies, a clear pattern emerged regarding the target population. The overwhelming majority of the research focused on individuals who were in the chronic phase of their stroke recovery. Furthermore, the studies predominantly concentrated their efforts on the rehabilitation of the upper extremities, which are the arms and hands. The settings in which this rehabilitation was delivered were also notable, with the majority of interventions taking place either within the familiar environment of the patients' homes or within institutional settings.

In terms of the specific digital health technologies that were investigated, a hierarchy of frequency was observed. The technologies that were most frequently studied included a combination of sensors and mobile tools, which are devices that can track movement and provide feedback, virtual reality (VR) and telerehabilitation approaches, which often incorporated exergames (exercise-based video games), and gaming systems in general. Less frequently, but still importantly, robotic devices were also included in the scope of the review. The findings from these studies were generally encouraging. Many of the investigated DHTs demonstrated feasibility, meaning they were practical to implement. Furthermore, a significant number of studies reported high levels of patient engagement, suggesting that these technologies were appealing and motivating to individuals undergoing rehabilitation. Importantly, many also reported positive outcomes in terms of functional improvements. However, it is also essential to acknowledge the challenges that were consistently identified. These barriers to implementation and widespread adoption included technical issues, such as glitches or connectivity problems, concerns regarding usability, meaning how easy the technology was for patients and clinicians to operate, and limitations related to access and training, highlighting that not everyone had the necessary equipment or the skills to effectively use the technologies.

In conclusion, the authors of this scoping review firmly assert that digital health technologies hold substantial promise for enhancing and improving the delivery of stroke rehabilitation services across Canada. Nevertheless, their findings underscore a critical need for further advancements. Specifically, they highlight the necessity for more rigorous and robust clinical trials to provide stronger evidence of effectiveness. Additionally, they emphasize the requirement for a broader consideration of outcome measures. This means expanding the focus beyond just motor function to include a more comprehensive assessment of areas such as cognitive abilities
