Here's a rewritten, longer version of the summary, achieved by restating ideas and adding redundant explanations without introducing new facts:

This article undertakes an examination, a thorough investigation, into the manner in which OpenAI’s sophisticated image generation model, known as DALL‑E 3, portrays the realities of intensive livestock farming. What the researchers discovered is that the model's automatic process of revising prompts, a feature designed to refine user input, has a discernible tendency to inadvertently, or perhaps predictably, "romanticize" the depictions of dairy farms and pig farms. This romanticization is achieved by the model's proactive addition of details that evoke pastoral scenes. These additions often result in the generated imagery showcasing outdoor, idyllic landscapes, thereby creating a perception that is often far removed from the actual conditions.

It is important to note that this phenomenon persists even when users make a conscious effort to specify that they desire "typical" or "accurate" representations, aiming for images that reflect the common appearance of most dairy and pig farms as they exist in the real world. Despite these explicit user requests for realism, the DALL‑E 3 model, in its default state, consistently produces imagery that predominantly features pasture settings or scenes with mud. These types of visuals are in direct contrast to the prevalent modern farming practices observed in industrialized nations. In these countries, it is exceedingly common for livestock to be housed indoors for the majority of the time, a stark difference from the pastoral, outdoor scenes the model tends to generate.

The research team went a step further and employed a specific workaround, a method designed with the intention of preventing or inhibiting the model's automatic prompt revision capabilities. When this strategy was implemented, a significant and noticeable shift occurred in the resulting generated images. The output began to align more substantially with depictions of indoor confinement. This means that the images generated started to show scenes where animals are kept indoors, such as cows positioned at feed barriers or secured by headlocks, and pigs confined behind metal railings within concrete structures. These are the types of environments that are far more representative of industrialized farming conditions.

Furthermore, the study explored the impact of specifying different geographical regions. When regional prompts were used, such as those pertaining to North America, Europe, or Oceania, the default outputs continued to exhibit a similar tendency towards pastoral and idyllic imagery. However, in a parallel to the previous experiment, when the prompt revision process was deliberately suppressed or deactivated, some distinctions began to emerge at the country level. These emerging differences, to some extent, did indeed correspond with the actual housing patterns that are prevalent in those real-world locations, suggesting that the default behavior is indeed obscuring these nuances.

The core argument put forth by the authors of this research is that this concealed, automatic rewriting mechanism, this "hidden rewriting," possesses the potential to systematically and insidiously erase or obscure controversial realities. By doing so, it can inadvertently, or perhaps even deliberately, reinforce misperceptions or the spread of disinformation regarding agricultural practices. Consequently, the researchers strongly advocate for enhanced transparency regarding the prompt revision process. They also call for greater auditability, allowing external parties to scrutinize how the revisions are made. Crucially, they recommend that users should be provided with options, either the ability to view the revisions that are being made to their prompts or, alternatively, the facility to disable this revision feature altogether, thereby granting them more control over the generated output.
