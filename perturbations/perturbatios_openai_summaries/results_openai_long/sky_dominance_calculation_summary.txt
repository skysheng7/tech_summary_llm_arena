Here's a rewritten, longer summary that restates ideas and adds redundant explanations without introducing new facts:

This particular piece of research embarked on an investigation into a specific question: does the way we understand the social ranking or pecking order among dairy cows, which is derived from observations of cows taking over another's spot at the feed bunk (referred to as "replacement" events), undergo modifications or shifts when the intensity of competition for resources, specifically food, is altered? To address this, the researchers gathered an extensive amount of data, collecting it continuously over a period of ten months. This data was derived from a group of cows that was not static but rather a dynamic population, meaning the composition of the group changed over time. At any given point, there were 48 individual cows within the group, but over the entire duration of the study, a total of 159 different cows participated.

In order to objectively measure and quantify the level of competition occurring at the feeding stations, the study utilized real-time data related to how occupied the feeders were at any given moment. This metric, referred to as "feeder occupancy," served as the primary indicator of competition intensity. Building upon this measurement, the researchers then constructed distinct social dominance hierarchies. These hierarchies were developed using a statistical approach known as the Elo rating system, a method often employed in games and sports to track relative skill levels. Crucially, a separate Elo-based hierarchy was generated for each of the 25 different levels of feeder occupancy that were observed and recorded during the study.

The findings that emerged from this detailed analysis revealed a consistent pattern: as the level of feeder occupancy, and therefore the intensity of competition, went up, there was a corresponding and consistent decrease in the steepness of the social hierarchy. In simpler terms, the hierarchy became flatter. This flattening of the hierarchy signified that the distinctions between dominant and subordinate individuals became less pronounced. Furthermore, an increase in feeder occupancy also led to a greater number of interactions between pairs of cows where the outcome was not consistently one-sided. Specifically, more "dyads" (pairs of cows) began to exhibit two-way interactions, meaning that it was not always the same cow that was dominant. This indicated an increase in the frequency of dominance reversals, where a cow that was typically dominant might be displaced, and a general reduction in the stability and consistency of established dominance relationships.

Delving deeper into the observations at the highest levels of competition, which corresponded to the highest feeder occupancy rates, the study observed that in a greater proportion of cow pairs, the cow that had been identified as the dominant one at lower levels of competition (when the hierarchy was steeper and dominance was clearer) was now found to be losing its dominant position more frequently. In other words, the cow that was initially considered dominant, based on interactions when resources were less contested, experienced a proportionally greater number of instances where it was displaced by another cow. The study further noted that the win rate of these initially dominant cows continued to decline as the level of feeder occupancy continued to rise, emphasizing the impact of intense competition on established social structures.

Based on these observations and analyses, the researchers have put forth a concluding argument. They assert that periods of high competition, which are often associated with high perceived value of the resource being competed for (in this case, feed), possess the potential to overpower or supersede the intrinsic attributes that typically define a cow's social dominance.
