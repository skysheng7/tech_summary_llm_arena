This paper puts forth a comprehensive, step-by-step process, what can be called an end-to-end workflow, specifically designed for the crucial task of generating high-quality initial states. These initial states are intended to be used as a starting point for quantum energy estimation algorithms, which are of significant interest in the field of quantum chemistry. A central and very important message conveyed by the authors is that the ultimate quality and goodness of these initial states have a profound and substantial impact on the overall duration, or runtime, of the quantum energy estimation process. In other words, if you start with a better initial state, you can expect the entire quantum computation to finish more quickly.

To address the challenge of quantifying and understanding what constitutes a "high-quality" initial state, the paper introduces a novel metric. This metric is not just theoretical but also practical, meaning it can be readily applied in real-world scenarios. This new quality metric is defined as the state's **energy distribution** when it is evaluated across the entire spectrum of the Hamiltonian. In simpler terms, it involves examining how the energy of the initial state is spread out or distributed when subjected to the Hamiltonian operator, which represents the total energy of a quantum system. The authors then go on to propose and detail several methods for approximating this energy distribution. These methods can be performed either using classical computing resources or by leveraging quantum computing capabilities. Among the classical approaches are series expansions and a resolvent/Green's-function based approach. On the quantum side, they suggest a technique involving coarse Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) sampling. Critically, these methods for approximating the energy distribution can be employed *without* requiring prior knowledge of the system's true ground state, which is often an unknown that quantum algorithms aim to find.

For the actual implementation of these initial state preparation techniques, the researchers have developed a more efficient algorithm. This algorithm is designed to be fault-tolerant, which is an important consideration for future quantum computers that are expected to have errors. The specific task this algorithm performs is loading **sums of Slater determinants**. Slater determinants are a fundamental way to represent the electronic wave function of a multi-electron system in quantum chemistry. The efficiency of this new loading algorithm is highlighted by its Toffoli cost, which is a measure of the computational resources required, scaling as \(O(D\log D)\). This represents a significant improvement over previously existing approaches, which typically had costs of \(O(ND)\)-type, suggesting a more scalable solution as the system size (represented by D) and other parameters (represented by N) increase. Furthermore, the paper extends its analysis to include the preparation of **matrix product states**. Matrix product states are another important class of states in quantum many-body physics and quantum chemistry, often used for their ability to efficiently represent certain types of quantum states, and their preparation costs are also examined.

As a practical and cost-effective strategy for refining the initial states and improving the overall energy estimation process, the authors advocate for the use of **low-precision (coarse) QPE in conjunction with postselection**. This approach is presented as a cheap "refinement" step. Its purpose is twofold: firstly, it aims to filter out components of the initial state that correspond to high energies, thereby focusing the subsequent computations on more relevant parts of the state. Secondly, it serves as a diagnostic and mitigation tool for a phenomenon known as QPE "
