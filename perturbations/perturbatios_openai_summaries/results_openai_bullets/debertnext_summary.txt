Here is the summary converted into bullet points:

*   DeBERTNeXT is a multimodal fake news detection framework.
*   It classifies news as real or fake by jointly using an article’s text and its accompanying image.
*   Text representations are extracted with the DeBERTa V3 transformer.
*   Image representations are extracted with a ConvNeXT Large model.
*   These features are concatenated.
*   A final sigmoid classifier is applied.
*   The model is trained and evaluated on the Fakeddit dataset, and the Politifact and Gossipcop benchmarks.
*   Transfer learning is used.
*   A consistent preprocessing pipeline is used for images and tokenized text.
*   DeBERTNeXT achieves higher performance than prior multimodal baselines.
*   Performance improvements include approximately 3.8% accuracy on Fakeddit.
*   Performance improvements include approximately 2.1% accuracy on Politifact.
*   Performance improvements include approximately 1.0% accuracy on Gossipcop.
*   The paper concludes that combining stronger modern backbones for language and vision yields more effective multimodal fake news detection.
*   The paper suggests extending the approach to additional modalities like audio and video.
