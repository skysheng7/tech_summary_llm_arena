Here is the summary converted into bullet points, preserving all information and without adding anything new:

*   This scoping review examined the use of digital health technologies (DHTs) for stroke rehabilitation in Canada.
*   It also identified remaining gaps for clinical, research, and policy decision-making.
*   The review utilized database and grey-literature searches.
*   A total of 14 Canadian studies were identified.
*   These studies were published between 2010 and 2022.
*   The included studies comprised qualitative studies and randomized controlled trials.
*   The majority of studies targeted individuals in the chronic phase of stroke.
*   The primary focus of the studies was upper-extremity rehabilitation.
*   Rehabilitation was delivered mainly at home or in institutions.
*   The most frequently studied technologies included:
    *   Sensors/mobile tools
    *   Virtual reality
    *   Telerehabilitation (including exergames)
    *   Gaming systems
*   Robotic devices were studied less frequently.
*   Many studies reported positive findings such as:
    *   Feasibility
    *   Good engagement
    *   Functional improvements
*   Barriers identified in studies included:
    *   Technical issues
    *   Usability challenges
    *   Access/training constraints
*   The authors concluded that DHTs hold promise for improving stroke rehabilitation in Canada.
*   However, more rigorous trials are needed.
*   Broader outcome coverage is also required to support equitable implementation.
*   Areas needing broader outcome coverage include:
    *   Cognition
    *   Lower extremity function
    *   Activities of daily living (ADLs)
    *   Mental health
    *   Earlier stroke phases
