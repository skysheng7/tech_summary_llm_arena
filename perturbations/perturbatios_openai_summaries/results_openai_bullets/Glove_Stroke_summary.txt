Here is the summary converted into bullet points, preserving all information:

*   The systematic review investigated if wearable robotic gloves improve hand function in post-stroke individuals.
*   A search of major databases was conducted up to September 2021.
*   2674 records were initially identified.
*   Only five small studies met the inclusion criteria.
*   These studies had between 3 and 13 participants.
*   Participants were mostly individuals with chronic or subacute stroke.
*   All five studies reported improvements in hand/upper-limb outcomes after glove-based training.
*   The reviewed devices included EPHO, PneuGlove, X-Glove, HandinMind, and IronHand.
*   These devices generally targeted finger extension or grip/task performance.
*   Training involved task-oriented practice and/or game/virtual-reality exercises.
*   Intervention duration was typically 4–6 weeks.
*   The methodological quality of the studies was rated as moderate (7–10/12 on an adapted Downs and Black checklist).
*   There were no randomized controlled trials included.
*   The studies lacked control groups.
*   Sample sizes were limited.
*   Participant characterization was limited (e.g., spasticity severity was not always detailed).
*   The authors concluded that the results are promising.
*   However, there is no standardized intervention approach or timing identified.
*   Larger, higher-quality comparative studies are needed to confirm therapeutic effectiveness.
