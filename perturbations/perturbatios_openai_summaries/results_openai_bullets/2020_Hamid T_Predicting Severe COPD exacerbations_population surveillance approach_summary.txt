Here's the summary converted into bullet points, preserving all information:

*   The study utilized British Columbia administrative health data from 1997 to 2016.
*   The aim was to develop a population-surveillance model to predict severe COPD exacerbations necessitating hospitalization.
*   For each patient diagnosed with COPD, predictors from the preceding 6 months were used.
*   These predictors estimated the risk of a COPD hospitalization within the subsequent 2 months.
*   Recent post-discharge readmissions were excluded from this risk estimation.
*   The study compared the performance of logistic regression, random forest, neural networks, and gradient boosting models.
*   Temporal validation was conducted on a later time period.
*   Gradient boosting demonstrated the best performance.
*   Gradient boosting achieved an AUC of 0.82 in validation.
*   This AUC of 0.82 for gradient boosting is compared to 0.68 for a reference model using only prior exacerbation history.
*   Gradient boosting also showed good calibration.
*   The findings suggest that routinely collected administrative data can accurately identify high-risk individuals.
*   This identification can facilitate targeted preventive interventions.
*   It can also support scalable outreach programs.
