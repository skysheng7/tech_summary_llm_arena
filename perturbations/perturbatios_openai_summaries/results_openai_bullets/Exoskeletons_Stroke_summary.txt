Here is the summary converted into bullet points:

*   This systematic review analyzed studies published between 2010 and 2017.
*   The studies focused on poststroke rehabilitation techniques that combined exoskeleton or robotic devices with virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), or gamification.
*   The aim of these combined approaches was to improve motor function and participation.
*   The review used PRISMA-guided searches.
*   Databases searched included MEDLINE, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, and the Cochrane Library.
*   A total of 30 studies were included.
*   Approximately 385 participants were involved across the included studies.
*   The included studies encompassed both randomized trials and exploratory designs.
*   The majority of interventions focused on the upper limb (28 out of 30 studies).
*   Most interventions were carried out in clinical settings (25 out of 30 studies).
*   Interventions were evenly split between VR-based and game-based interfaces.
*   No AR-based stroke-exoskeleton studies were identified within the included sample.
*   The studies included were heterogeneous in their designs and outcome measures (e.g., Fugl-Meyer, WMFT, MAS).
*   The review found generally positive improvements in motor function and engagement.
*   These positive improvements were observed when VR or game elements were combined with exoskeleton therapy.
*   The authors suggest that these technologies have the potential to facilitate the transition of rehabilitation from clinic to home.
*   The authors highlight the necessity for more studies conducted in home settings.
*   The authors emphasize the need for better-designed, customizable "serious games."
*   The goal of improved "serious games" is to maintain motivation and usability outside of the clinic.
