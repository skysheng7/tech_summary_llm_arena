Here is the summary converted into bullet points, preserving all information:

*   The BMJ's statistical editors, particularly during the Christmas submission rush, frequently encounter the same avoidable statistical and reporting problems in manuscripts.
*   The article presents "12 days of Christmas" as 12 common issues.
*   The first issue is to clearly define the research question and estimand.
*   Emphasis should be placed on effect estimates, confidence intervals, and clinical relevance, rather than solely on P values.
*   Frequent methodological pitfalls include mishandling missing data.
*   Another pitfall is dichotomising continuous variables.
*   Assuming linear relationships when they may be non-linear is also highlighted.
*   Making untested claims about subgroup differences is a common problem.
*   The article warns against failing to account for clustering.
*   Misinterpreting meta-analysis heterogeneity statistics (like I²) is another issue.
*   Overusing meta-regression is also mentioned.
*   Inadequately evaluating prediction models, especially calibration and overfitting, is a pitfall.
*   Authors are urged to check assumptions with sensitivity analyses.
*   Questionable variable selection practices should be avoided.
*   Authors should follow appropriate reporting guidelines (e.g., CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA, TRIPOD).
*   Finally, authors should avoid overinterpretation or "spin."
