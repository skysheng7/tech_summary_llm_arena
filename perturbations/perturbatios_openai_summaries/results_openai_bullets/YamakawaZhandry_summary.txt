Here's the summary converted into bullet points, preserving all information and without adding anything new:

*   Relative to a uniformly random oracle, Yamakawa and Zhandry demonstrate NP *search* problems solvable by quantum polynomial-time algorithms that are intractable for any classical probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm.
*   This intractability for classical algorithms holds even if they are computationally unbounded but limited to polynomially many *classical* oracle queries.
*   They construct a *publicly verifiable* proof of quantumness with minimal interaction.
    *   It is non-interactive for uniform adversaries.
    *   It is two-message public-coin for non-uniform (oracle-dependent advice) adversaries.
*   Using similar techniques, they create cryptographic separations showing certain primitives are secure against classical query-bounded attackers but easily invertible by quantum attackers.
    *   This includes one-way functions.
    *   This includes collision-resistant hash functions.
    *   Further counterexamples are provided for signatures.
    *   Further counterexamples are provided for CPA-secure public-key encryption (assuming a classically CPA-secure scheme exists).
*   Their constructions combine random-oracle outputs with strong error-correcting code properties (list recoverability) to prevent classical inversion.
*   A quantum Fourier-transform–based procedure is used to efficiently sample preimages.
*   They assert these results do not contradict the Aaronson–Ambainis conjecture (which pertains to decision problems).
*   Assuming the Aaronson–Ambainis conjecture, they also achieve minimally interactive, publicly verifiable “certifiable randomness” protocols.
*   Replacing the random oracle with a concrete hash function like SHA-2 allows for plausible “Minicrypt-style” instantiations that do not require heavy algebraic structure.
