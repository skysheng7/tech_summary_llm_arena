This study proposes a novel method for assessing lameness in dairy cows by constructing a lameness hierarchy based on pairwise comparisons rather than traditional gait scoring. The researchers found that traditional 5-level gait scoring showed poor reliability (ICC = 0.44-0.62), while their pairwise assessment method achieved high inter-observer reliability among experts (ICC = 0.81). The method proved feasible for untrained crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk, with strong agreement between crowd workers and experts (ICC = 0.85). Using a subsampling algorithm, the researchers determined that only 8 crowd workers per video pair and approximately 37% of all possible pairwise comparisons were needed to construct a reliable hierarchy. This approach offers a more reliable, granular, and cost-effective way to label large datasets for training automated lameness detection systems.
