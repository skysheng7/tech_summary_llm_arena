# Summary of "Verifiable Quantum Advantage without Structure"

This paper by Yamakawa and Zhandry demonstrates unconditional quantum advantages using random oracles, without requiring the highly structured oracles or strong cryptographic assumptions needed in previous work. The key results include:

2. **Cryptographic Separations**: They show functions that are one-way or collision-resistant against classical adversaries but easily broken quantumly, providing counterexamples for various cryptographic primitives.

1. **NP Search Problems**: They construct NP search problems solvable efficiently by quantum computers but not by classical computers, relative to a random oracle.

3. **Proofs of Quantumness**: They construct unconditional, publicly verifiable proofs of quantumness with minimal interaction (non-interactive for uniform adversaries, two-message for non-uniform).

4. **Certifiable Randomness**: Assuming the Aaronson-Ambainis conjecture, they construct protocols for certifiable randomness with minimal rounds of interaction.

5. **Technical Approach**: The construction uses folded Reed-Solomon codes with specific list-recoverability properties, where quantum algorithms can efficiently find preimages using quantum Fourier transforms while classical algorithms cannot due to information-theoretic list-recovery bounds.
