Here is the reordered summary:

This study developed a method for assessing dairy cattle lameness using crowdsourced comparative assessments, where workers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk watched pairs of videos showing cows walking and identified which cow was more lame. The researchers created 11 tasks with 10 video pairs each and recruited 50 workers per task, comparing their responses to those of 5 experienced cattle lameness assessors. Results showed moderate to high agreement among crowd workers (ICC = 0.46-0.77) and excellent agreement among experienced assessors (ICC = 0.87), with the average crowd worker responses showing excellent agreement with experienced assessor responses (ICC = 0.89-0.91). The study found that only 10 workers per task were needed to achieve reliable results with high agreement to experts (ICC > 0.80). This method provides a fast, cost-effective way to assess lameness in commercial herds and enables large-scale data collection for training computer vision algorithms for automated lameness detection.
