Here's the summary converted into bullet points:

*   The study proposes a novel method for assessing lameness in dairy cows.
*   This method constructs a lameness hierarchy based on pairwise comparisons.
*   This is a departure from traditional gait scoring.
*   Traditional 5-level gait scoring showed poor reliability (ICC = 0.44-0.62).
*   The proposed pairwise assessment method achieved high inter-observer reliability among experts (ICC = 0.81).
*   The method was found to be feasible for untrained crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk.
*   There was strong agreement between crowd workers and experts (ICC = 0.85).
*   A subsampling algorithm was used to determine the number of workers and comparisons needed.
*   Only 8 crowd workers per video pair were needed.
*   Approximately 37% of all possible pairwise comparisons were needed to construct a reliable hierarchy.
*   This approach offers a more reliable labeling method for large datasets.
*   This approach offers a more granular labeling method for large datasets.
*   This approach offers a more cost-effective labeling method for large datasets.
*   The ultimate goal is to train automated lameness detection systems.
