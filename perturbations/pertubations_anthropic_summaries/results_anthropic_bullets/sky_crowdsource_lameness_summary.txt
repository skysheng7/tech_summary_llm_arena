Here is the summary converted into bullet points:

*   A method was developed for assessing dairy cattle lameness using crowdsourced comparative assessments.
*   Workers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk watched pairs of videos showing cows walking and identified which cow was more lame.
*   The researchers created 11 tasks, each with 10 video pairs.
*   50 workers were recruited per task.
*   Worker responses were compared to those of 5 experienced cattle lameness assessors.
*   Results showed moderate to high agreement among crowd workers (ICC = 0.46-0.77).
*   Excellent agreement was observed among experienced assessors (ICC = 0.87).
*   The average crowd worker responses showed excellent agreement with experienced assessor responses (ICC = 0.89-0.91).
*   Only 10 workers per task were needed to achieve reliable results with high agreement to experts (ICC > 0.80).
*   This method is a fast, cost-effective way to assess lameness in commercial herds.
*   The method enables large-scale data collection for training computer vision algorithms for automated lameness detection.
