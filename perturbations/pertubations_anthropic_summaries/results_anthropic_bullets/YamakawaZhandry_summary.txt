Here's the summary converted into bullet points:

*   Yamakawa and Zhandry demonstrate unconditional quantum advantages using random oracles.
*   This work does not require highly structured oracles or strong cryptographic assumptions.
*   **NP Search Problems**:
    *   They construct NP search problems solvable efficiently by quantum computers.
    *   These problems are not solvable efficiently by classical computers, relative to a random oracle.
*   **Cryptographic Separations**:
    *   They show functions that are one-way or collision-resistant against classical adversaries.
    *   These functions are easily broken quantumly, serving as counterexamples for various cryptographic primitives.
*   **Proofs of Quantumness**:
    *   They construct unconditional, publicly verifiable proofs of quantumness.
    *   These proofs have minimal interaction:
        *   Non-interactive for uniform adversaries.
        *   Two-message for non-uniform adversaries.
*   **Certifiable Randomness**:
    *   Assuming the Aaronson-Ambainis conjecture, they construct protocols for certifiable randomness.
    *   These protocols require minimal rounds of interaction.
*   **Technical Approach**:
    *   The construction uses folded Reed-Solomon codes.
    *   These codes possess specific list-recoverability properties.
    *   Quantum algorithms can efficiently find preimages using quantum Fourier transforms.
    *   Classical algorithms cannot efficiently find preimages due to information-theoretic list-recovery bounds.
