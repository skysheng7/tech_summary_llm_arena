Here is the summary converted into bullet points:

*   **DeBERTNeXT** is a multimodal fake news detection framework.
*   It combines **textual and visual information** from news articles.
*   The model uses **DeBERTa V3** for processing text.
*   The model uses **ConvNeXT** for processing images.
*   Outputs from DeBERTa V3 and ConvNeXT are **concatenated**.
*   The concatenated output is used for **binary classification** of news as real or fake.
*   The framework was tested on three datasets:
    *   Fakeddit (154,644 records)
    *   Politifact (304 records)
    *   Gossipcop (8,008 records)
*   DeBERTNeXT achieved **state-of-the-art results**.
*   DeBERTNeXT outperformed existing models by:
    *   **3.80% on Fakeddit** (91.2% accuracy)
    *   **2.10% on Politifact** (91.3% accuracy)
    *   **1.00% on Gossipcop** (90.2% accuracy)
*   A key advantage is the use of **more advanced architectures** (DeBERTa and ConvNeXT) compared to commonly used models like BERT/XLNet and VGG-19.
*   This enables **better feature extraction** from both modalities.
*   The framework does **not require domain-specific preprocessing**.
*   The framework does **not require event-based dependencies**.
