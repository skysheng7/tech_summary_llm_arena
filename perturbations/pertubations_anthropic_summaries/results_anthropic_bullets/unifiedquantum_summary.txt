Here is the summary converted into bullet points:

*   **No-encoding theorem**: A general no-go theorem is proven that forbids linearly superposing an unknown pure state with a fixed state using a universal quantum transformation.
    *   This theorem unifies the no-cloning, no-deleting, and no-superposing theorems as special cases.

*   **Unified transformation scheme**: A scheme for perfect and imperfect quantum cloning and deleting of pure states in a finite set is presented.
    *   This scheme is completely characterized by the linear independence of input states.
    *   Generalized bounds on success probability are provided.

*   **Superposition of restricted states**: Schemes for superposing unknown states with fixed overlaps are generalized when multiple copies are available.
    *   This generalization extends beyond previous overlap conditions.

*   **Mathematical framework**: The results depend on Hadamard products of matrices, the Schur product theorem, and Stinespring's theorem.
    *   These tools are used to characterize when quantum transformations exist.

*   **Practical implications**: The theoretical results have implications for quantum cryptography and quantum information processing.
    *   They also contribute to understanding fundamental limitations imposed by quantum mechanics on state transformations.
