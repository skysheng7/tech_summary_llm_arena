Here is the summary converted into bullet points, preserving all information:

*   This scoping review examined the use of Digital Health Technologies (DHTs) in stroke rehabilitation across Canada.
*   14 studies published between 2010 and 2022 were analyzed.
*   Most research focused on upper extremity rehabilitation (85.71%).
*   The chronic phase of stroke was the primary focus (64.3%).
*   Studies were primarily conducted in home settings (50%).
*   Technologies utilized included sensors, virtual reality, gaming systems, telerehabilitation, and robotics.
*   DHTs were demonstrated to be feasible and effective in improving:
    *   Motor function
    *   Patient engagement
    *   Quality of life
*   Key facilitators for DHT use included:
    *   User motivation
    *   Clinician support
    *   Technology performance
*   Barriers to DHT use included:
    *   Technical challenges
    *   User inexperience
    *   Limited device portability
*   Significant research gaps were identified in:
    *   Lower extremity function
    *   Cognition
    *   Activities of daily living
    *   Mental health
    *   Acute/subacute phases of stroke recovery
*   The authors recommend future Canadian research should:
    *   Prioritize high-quality randomized controlled trials.
    *   Expand research beyond upper extremity outcomes.
    *   Address earlier phases of stroke recovery.
    *   Ensure equitable access for culturally diverse populations.
    *   Ensure equitable access for rural populations.
*   These recommendations aim to advance the integration of DHTs into clinical practice.
