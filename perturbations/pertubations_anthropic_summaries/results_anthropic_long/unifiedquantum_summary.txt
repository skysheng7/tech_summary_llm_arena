**Expanded Summary of "Unified quantum no-go theorems and transforming of quantum states in a restricted set"**

This extensive research paper delves deeply into the intricate question of which quantum state transformations are intrinsically forbidden and which are permissable, all within the fundamental framework dictated by the principle of quantum superposition. The central focus of this work is to meticulously explore the boundaries and possibilities of manipulating quantum states, particularly when these manipulations involve the combination or transformation of states that are not precisely known beforehand. The paper presents several key findings and advancements that significantly contribute to our understanding of quantum information theory.

The foremost and most impactful contribution of this paper is the introduction and rigorous proof of what the authors term the **no-encoding theorem**. This theorem establishes a profound and general quantum no-go result, fundamentally prohibiting the act of linearly superposing an unknown pure quantum state with a state that is precisely known and fixed, when this superposition is attempted via a universal quantum transformation. It's crucial to understand that this no-encoding theorem is not merely an isolated observation; it is presented as a unifying principle. This means that a range of previously established and important no-go theorems in quantum mechanics, specifically the no-cloning theorem (which prevents the perfect duplication of an unknown quantum state), the no-deleting theorem (which prevents the perfect erasure of an unknown quantum state), and the no-superposing theorem (which deals with the inability to perfectly combine unknown states in certain ways), can all be elegantly understood and derived as special, degenerate cases of this more general no-encoding theorem. The universal quantum transformation being considered is one that is capable of performing any general unitary operation on the quantum system.

Following this foundational theoretical result, the paper then proceeds to introduce a novel **unified transformation scheme**. This scheme is designed to address the creation of perfect and imperfect copies of quantum states, as well as the deletion of quantum states, specifically for pure states that belong to a restricted or finite set. The fundamental condition that dictates the success and limitations of this scheme is entirely characterized by the mathematical concept of linear independence among the input states. If the input states are linearly independent, the scheme can operate. Furthermore, the paper provides a generalized framework for quantifying the bounds on the probability of success for these cloning and deleting operations, acknowledging that perfect success is not always achievable.

Expanding on the theme of superposition, the authors also generalize existing schemes that allow for the superposition of unknown quantum states. This generalization is particularly focused on scenarios where these unknown states possess fixed, known overlaps with each other, and importantly, where multiple identical copies of these states are available for manipulation. This extends the scope of such superposition operations beyond the stricter overlap conditions that were previously required by earlier research in the field. The availability of multiple copies is a crucial resource that enables these generalized superposition operations.

The robust mathematical underpinnings of these theoretical results are thoroughly explored and articulated. The authors reveal that their derivations and characterizations heavily rely on sophisticated mathematical tools. Specifically, they employ the concept of Hadamard products of matrices, also known as element-wise matrix multiplication. They also leverage the Schur product theorem, a fundamental result in matrix theory, and Stinespring's theorem, a key theorem in functional analysis related to dilations of completely positive maps. These mathematical frameworks are instrumental in precisely characterizing the conditions under which the proposed quantum transformations are
