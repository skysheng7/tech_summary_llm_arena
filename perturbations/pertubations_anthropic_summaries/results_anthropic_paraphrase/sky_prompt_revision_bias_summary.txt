Here's a paraphrased summary of the article, adhering to your constraints:

The research indicates that OpenAI's DALL-E 3 AI, designed to create images from text, consistently obscures the truth of concentrated animal farming by automatically modifying user prompts. This revision process results in the generation of picturesque, idealized scenes, such as cows grazing in meadows and pigs playing in mud. Even when users explicitly request "realistic" images of dairy or pig farms, the AI's prompt alteration mechanism incorporates idyllic elements, leading to visuals that do not represent the typical indoor, intensive housing conditions prevalent for most farmed animals in industrialized nations. Upon disabling the prompt revision feature, the generated images underwent a significant transformation, revealing animals within indoor confinement settings featuring metal enclosures and concrete flooring, which more accurately depict contemporary agricultural methods. Furthermore, when prompt revision was deactivated, a comparison across different regions demonstrated that the generated images' portrayal of outdoor versus indoor housing environments showed some correlation with actual statistics from the United States, Germany, New Zealand, Spain, and Australia. The researchers contend that this inherent bias, termed a "coded gaze," conceals difficult truths, disseminates inaccurate information about animal farming, and hinders constructive public discussion regarding the welfare of farm animals and the long-term societal viability of food production systems.
