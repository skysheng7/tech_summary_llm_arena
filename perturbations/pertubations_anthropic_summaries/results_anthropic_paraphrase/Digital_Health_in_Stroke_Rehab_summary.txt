Here are a few paraphrased options of the summary, each with different wording and sentence structure while preserving all original information:

**Option 1 (Focus on Scope and Findings):**

A comprehensive scoping review delved into the application of Digital Health Technologies (DHTs) within Canadian stroke rehabilitation, scrutinizing 14 studies published from 2010 to 2022. The analysis revealed a predominant concentration on upper limb recovery (85.71%) during the chronic stage of stroke (64.3%) and predominantly within home environments (50%). Technologies frequently employed included sensors, virtual reality, gaming consoles, telerehabilitation, and robotics. The research indicated that these interventions are both practical and beneficial, leading to enhancements in motor skills, patient involvement, and overall quality of life. Key factors promoting their success were user drive, support from healthcare professionals, and the technology's reliability. Conversely, obstacles such as technical difficulties, users' lack of familiarity with the devices, and restrictions on portability were noted. Nonetheless, the review highlighted considerable omissions, particularly concerning research into lower limb function, cognitive abilities, daily living activities, mental well-being, and the earlier acute and subacute stages of stroke recovery. The researchers propose that future Canadian investigations should prioritize robust randomized controlled trials, broaden their scope beyond upper limb results, investigate earlier recovery periods, and guarantee fair accessibility for diverse cultural groups and those in rural areas, thereby fostering the wider adoption of DHTs in clinical settings.

**Option 2 (Emphasis on Technologies and Outcomes):**

Investigating the landscape of Digital Health Technologies (DHTs) used in Canadian stroke rehabilitation, this scoping review synthesized findings from 14 studies conducted between 2010 and 2022. The majority of the research (85.71%) centered on the rehabilitation of the upper extremities, specifically during the chronic phase of stroke (64.3%), and most commonly occurred in home-based settings (50%). The technologies examined encompassed sensors, virtual reality, gaming systems, telerehabilitation, and robotics. Evidence from these studies suggests that these technologies are both feasible and effective, contributing to improvements in motor function, increased patient engagement, and enhanced quality of life. Crucial elements facilitating their use included user motivation, the support provided by clinicians, and the performance capabilities of the technology itself. However, challenges such as technical complexities, user inexperience, and limited device portability were identified as barriers. Significant research deficiencies were also observed, with a lack of focus on lower extremity function, cognition, daily living activities, mental health, and the acute and subacute phases of recovery. The authors advocate for future Canadian research efforts to prioritize high-quality randomized controlled trials, extend their focus beyond upper extremity outcomes, investigate earlier stages of stroke recovery, and ensure equitable access for culturally diverse and rural populations, all aimed at advancing the integration of DHTs into standard clinical practice.

**Option 3 (More Concise and Direct):**

A scoping review of 14 Canadian studies from 2010-2022 analyzed the use of Digital Health Technologies (DHTs) in stroke rehabilitation. The findings indicated a strong emphasis on upper extremity rehabilitation (85.71%) during the chronic phase (64.3%), predominantly in home settings (50%). Common technologies included sensors, virtual reality, gaming, telerehabilitation, and robotics. These technologies were found to
