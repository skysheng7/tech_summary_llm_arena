Here are a few paraphrased versions of the summary, using different wording and sentence structures while retaining all original information:

**Version 1:**

A new approach to evaluating lameness in dairy cows is presented, which builds a lameness hierarchy through the use of crowd-sourced data and pairwise comparisons, diverging from conventional gait scoring techniques. The investigation revealed that the conventional 5-level gait scoring system demonstrated low reliability (ICC = 0.44-0.62). In contrast, the proposed pairwise assessment method achieved excellent inter-observer agreement among experts (ICC = 0.81). Furthermore, this method proved practical for individuals without specialized training working on Amazon Mechanical Turk, showing robust agreement with expert assessments (ICC = 0.85). By employing a subsampling algorithm, the study determined that a reliable hierarchy could be constructed with just 8 crowd workers per video pair and by analyzing roughly 37% of all potential pairwise comparisons. This strategy provides a more dependable, detailed, and economical means of labeling extensive datasets for the development of automated lameness detection systems.

**Version 2:**

Researchers have developed an innovative technique for evaluating lameness in dairy cows. Instead of relying on traditional gait scoring, this method constructs a lameness hierarchy by analyzing pairwise comparisons. The study identified that conventional 5-level gait scoring exhibited poor reliability, with ICC values ranging from 0.44 to 0.62. However, the developed pairwise assessment method achieved high inter-observer reliability among experienced individuals (ICC = 0.81). The approach was also found to be viable for untrained crowd workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk, demonstrating strong consensus with experts (ICC = 0.85). Through the application of a subsampling algorithm, the team discovered that a reliable hierarchy could be established using as few as 8 crowd workers per video pair and analyzing approximately 37% of all possible pairwise comparisons. This novel method offers a more reliable, granular, and cost-efficient solution for labeling substantial datasets used in training automated lameness detection systems.

**Version 3:**

This research introduces a novel methodology for assessing lameness in dairy cows, moving beyond traditional gait scoring to build a lameness hierarchy through pairwise comparisons. The study found that traditional 5-level gait scoring possessed weak reliability, with ICCs between 0.44 and 0.62. Conversely, the researchers' pairwise assessment method achieved strong inter-observer reliability among experts, scoring an ICC of 0.81. The method's feasibility was also demonstrated with untrained crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk, showing a high level of agreement with expert judgments (ICC = 0.85). Utilizing a subsampling algorithm, it was determined that only 8 crowd workers were needed per video pair and approximately 37% of all potential pairwise comparisons were sufficient to construct a dependable hierarchy. This strategy presents a more reliable, granular, and economical avenue for labeling vast datasets intended for the training of automated lameness detection systems.
