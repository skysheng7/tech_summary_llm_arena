This research paper presents novel architectures for Large Language Models (LLMs) that are memory-efficient and reversible, drawing inspiration from physics-based differential equations. The core advancement lies in employing time-reversible dynamics to recreate hidden states during the backpropagation process. This eliminates the need to store all intermediate activations, leading to a substantial reduction in memory usage, potentially by a factor of 10. Consequently, this allows for considerably larger batch sizes. The researchers developed three distinct reversible architectural designs: Midpoint, Leapfrog, and Hamiltonian. They have shown that these models perform as well as or even outperform conventional transformers on a range of evaluation tasks, all while requiring substantially less memory. Furthermore, a technique is offered to transform current pre-trained models into reversible structures with minimal fine-tuning, thereby enhancing the practicality of this methodology for existing LLMs. Evaluations conducted on models such as GPT-2, TinyLlama, and SmolLM2 revealed that these reversible architectures not only shrink memory requirements but can also accelerate training speed by up to 101% for more complex models. This ultimately translates to shorter overall training durations, even with a slight increase in the number of computational operations performed.
