Here's a paraphrased summary of the article, using different wording and sentence structure while retaining all information:

1. A comprehensive systematic review analyzed 30 research papers published between 2010 and 2017, encompassing the application of exoskeletons alongside virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), or gamification for stroke survivors' recovery, involving a total of about 385 individuals.
2. The collected data indicated a strong emphasis on upper extremity rehabilitation, as 28 out of the 30 studies concentrated on this area over lower limb recovery. Among the exoskeleton devices most frequently utilized were the ARMin, Bi-Manu Track, and ArmeoSpring, with VR and gamification each being implemented in 15 of the studies.
3. Across the investigations employing these innovative interface methods, general enhancements in motor capabilities were observed, and patients exhibited heightened engagement and motivation when contrasted with conventional rehabilitation approaches.
4. A notable disparity was identified in the shift of rehabilitation from supervised clinical environments to independent home settings, as 25 of the studies took place in clinics compared to just 4 in residential settings, underscoring a requirement for more readily available at-home rehabilitation options.
5. The researchers noted an absence of AR-based systems within their reviewed materials and advocate for subsequent investigations aimed at creating personalized games that sustain patient interest, examining diverse interface technologies, and promoting effective rehabilitation therapies that can be conducted at home.
