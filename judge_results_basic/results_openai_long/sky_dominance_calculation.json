  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the central research question: how does the level of competition at the feeder affect the perceived dominance hierarchy in dairy cows?"
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical data and key findings presented in the summary align with the original paper, including the decrease in hierarchy steepness, the increase in two-way dyads, and the percentage changes associated with feeder occupancy."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively explains and uses key terms like 'dominance hierarchy', 'agonistic interactions', 'feeder occupancy', 'replacement events', and 'two-way dyads' in a coherent manner, making the findings understandable."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. This summary is significantly longer and is structured as a multi-section abstract rather than a concise 5-sentence overview."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is comprehensive, covering the research question, purpose, methods, key results, interpretation, and main recommendation. It accurately reflects the most important aspects of the paper."

    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not introduce any information or claims not present in the original research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 50,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent in its content, providing a thorough and accurate overview of the research, its methods, findings, and implications. However, it completely fails to adhere to the sentence limit requested in the original prompt, presenting a detailed abstract instead of a concise 5-sentence summary."
