  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the core research question of the paper: investigating the effectiveness of combining robotic exoskeletons with VR, AR, and gamification for stroke rehabilitation, with a focus on the transition to home-based therapy."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the quantitative data presented in the paper, such as the number of studies (30), participants (~385), the split between upper and lower limb studies (28/2), and the settings (25 clinic, 4 home, 1 both). The mention of specific outcome measures and exoskeleton devices is also accurate."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively uses and implicitly explains key terms like VR, AR, gamification, and exoskeleton within the context of stroke rehabilitation. The coherence is excellent, logically progressing from purpose to methods, findings, and conclusions."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary is not in the requested 5-sentence format. It is a structured, multi-paragraph summary with bullet points, significantly exceeding the sentence limit."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is highly complete and relevant, covering all major aspects of the original paper: the purpose, methodology, key findings (including statistics and specific examples), notable gaps, conclusions, and overall takeaway. It captures the essence of the research accurately."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the content of the original paper and does not introduce any unsupported claims or information not present in the source document."
  },
  "total_score": 50,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is exceptionally comprehensive and factually accurate, providing a detailed and well-structured overview of the research paper's purpose, methods, findings, and conclusions. However, it completely fails to adhere to the prompt's constraint of a 5-sentence summary."
