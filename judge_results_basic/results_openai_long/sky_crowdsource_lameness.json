  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately identifies and articulates the core research question: the reliability of untrained crowd workers for dairy cow lameness assessment using comparative methods."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key numerical findings, experimental setup, and conclusions presented in the paper, including ICC values and the number of workers needed."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary does a good job of explaining terms like 'pairwise comparisons' and 'ICC' within the context. The use of bullet points and bolding improves readability and coherence. A slightly more explicit explanation of ICC could be beneficial but is not strictly necessary for a summary."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is significantly longer due to the inclusion of detailed bullet points explaining the background, methods, results, and conclusions. This directly violates the sentence count constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is comprehensive, covering the research question, methodology, key results (including statistical measures and practical implications), and conclusions. All information included is highly relevant to understanding the study."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the provided text. There are no unsupported or fabricated statements."
  },
  "total_score": 49,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is excellent in its factual accuracy, completeness, and clarity of explanation regarding the research question and findings. However, it completely fails to adhere to the strict sentence count limitation of the original prompt, rendering it a detailed overview rather than a concise summary."
