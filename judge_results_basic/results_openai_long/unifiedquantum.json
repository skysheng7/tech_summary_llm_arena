  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research question of the paper, which is to unify no-go theorems related to quantum transformations and explore what becomes possible under restricted conditions."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the main contributions and theorems presented in the paper, including the no-encoding theorem, unified no-go theorems, and the framework for probabilistic cloning/deleting and superposing on restricted sets. The distinction between universal impossibility and probabilistic achievability on restricted sets is well-maintained."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Key terms like 'no-go theorems,' 'superposition principle,' 'linearly independent sets,' 'probabilistic CP maps,' and 'universal transformations' are used appropriately. While the summary doesn't extensively explain each term, it integrates them coherently within the context of quantum information theory."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a summary of 5 sentences. The provided summary is significantly longer, structured as an in-depth overview with multiple bullet points and sections. Therefore, it completely fails to adhere to the sentence count constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is highly complete and relevant, covering all three main contributions of the paper in detail. It provides a clear breakdown of the no-go results, the framework for restricted sets, and the superposing schemes, along with the overall takeaway message."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is grounded in the provided text and does not introduce any unsupported claims or fabricated information."
  },
  "total_score": 45,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary excels in its factual accuracy, completeness, and relevance, providing a detailed and coherent overview of the paper's complex contributions. However, it completely fails to adhere to the prompt's strict 5-sentence limit, making its adherence to the prompt a significant weakness."
