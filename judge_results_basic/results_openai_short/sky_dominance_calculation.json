  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the central research question concerning the impact of competition intensity on dairy cow dominance hierarchies."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings of the study, including the inverse relationship between feeder occupancy and hierarchy steepness, the increase in two-way dyads, and the decline in the dominant individual's win rate at higher occupancy levels. Numerical values mentioned (e.g., 48 cows, 159 total, 10 months, 25 occupancy levels) are correct."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively uses and implicitly explains key terms like 'replacement events,' 'feeder occupancy,' 'Elo-based hierarchies,' and 'hierarchy steepness.' The explanation of 'two-way dyads' is particularly clear. The flow of information is logical and easy to follow."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is precisely 5 sentences long, directly adhering to the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core findings, methodology (sensor data, Elo-based hierarchies, feeder occupancy as competition), and the main conclusion of the paper. It is highly relevant to the research question."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "No unsupported claims or information not present in the original paper were found in the summary."
  },
  "total_score": 60,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent, perfectly meeting all the criteria. It precisely follows the sentence count, accurately conveys the study's methodology and findings, and clearly articulates the implications of the research."
