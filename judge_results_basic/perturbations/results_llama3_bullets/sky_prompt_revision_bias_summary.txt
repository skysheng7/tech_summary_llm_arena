  "research_question": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary touches upon the research question but doesn't explicitly state it or delve into the specific focus of the paper (livestock farming). It's too general."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The statements made in the summary are factually accurate based on the content of the paper, although they are very general."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The terminology used is generally understandable, but terms like 'AI' and 'bias' are not explained within the summary itself. The coherence is good, but the generality makes it less impactful."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary consists of 5 bullet points, not 5 sentences as requested by the prompt. This is a direct violation of the prompt's constraints."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is too broad and doesn't capture the specific nuances and findings of the paper regarding livestock farming and prompt revision. It focuses on general AI biases rather than the study's main contribution."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "There are no claims made in the summary that are not supported by the paper."
  },
  "total_score": 38,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary accurately reflects general concerns about AI bias and misinformation but fails to adhere to the prompt's sentence limit and lacks the specificity to represent the paper's core findings on livestock farming. Its generality limits its usefulness as a concise summary of this particular research."
