  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question of the article, which is to present 12 common statistical errors and recommendations for researchers to improve their manuscript submissions to The BMJ."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All the points mentioned in the summary are directly supported by the text of the article. The list of 12 statistical issues and the key takeaways are accurately represented."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary lists several statistical terms (e.g., estimands, p-values, confidence intervals, dichotomizing, meta-regression, calibration, variable selection, reporting guidelines) without detailed explanation, which is expected in a summary. However, the overall coherence is good, and the terms are presented in a context that is generally understandable for someone familiar with research."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a summary in 5 sentences. The provided summary is presented as a list of bullet points and contains significantly more than 5 distinct points and sentences. This does not adhere to the sentence limit."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the major aspects of the article: the theme, the purpose, the 12 key statistical issues, important statistical concepts mentioned (like clinical significance vs. statistical significance), and the importance of reporting guidelines. It is highly relevant to the source material."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the content of the article and does not introduce any unsupported claims or information not present in the source text."
  },
  "total_score": 47,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is comprehensive and factually accurate, providing a detailed overview of the article's content and key recommendations. However, it fails entirely to adhere to the prompt's requirement of a 5-sentence summary, presenting instead a lengthy list of bullet points."
