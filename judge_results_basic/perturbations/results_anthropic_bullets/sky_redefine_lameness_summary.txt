  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question of developing a novel method for lameness assessment using crowd-sourced data and pairwise comparisons, contrasting it with traditional methods."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All stated facts, including ICC values and the number of workers/comparisons, are accurately reflected in the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively uses and implicitly explains key terms like 'lameness hierarchy,' 'pairwise comparisons,' and 'ICC' through their context and accurate reporting of values, making it coherent and understandable."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a summary of 5 sentences. The provided summary, when converted to bullet points, contains 14 distinct points, far exceeding the requested sentence limit. It appears the summary was generated as a list rather than a concise narrative."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the most critical aspects of the paper, including the problem, the proposed solution, its validation, key findings (reliability, crowd worker feasibility, subsampling), and its implications for automated systems. It is highly relevant to the paper's content."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the findings and methods described in the original paper and does not introduce any unsupported or fabricated information."
  },
  "total_score": 50,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is factually accurate, comprehensive, and relevant, effectively conveying the study's core contributions and findings. However, it significantly fails to adhere to the prompt's constraint of a 5-sentence limit, presenting the information as an extensive bulleted list instead of a concise narrative."
