  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the core research question: how dominance hierarchies change with competition levels in dairy cows."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reports key numerical findings like the decrease in hierarchy steepness and the increase in two-way dyads, directly reflecting the paper's results."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Terms like 'feeder occupancy,' 'hierarchy steepness,' and 'two-way dyads' are used and implicitly understood within the context of the summary. More explicit definitions might enhance coherence for a broader audience, but for a summary of a technical paper, it's adequately coherent."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is presented as bullet points and is significantly longer than 5 sentences, failing to adhere to the sentence count constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the study's objective, key findings, behavioral changes observed, interpretation, and recommendations, providing a comprehensive overview of the paper's main contributions."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by information present in the original research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 46,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary effectively captures the essence of the research paper, detailing the objective, findings, and interpretations with factual accuracy. However, it completely fails to adhere to the prompt's requirement of a 5-sentence summary, presenting the information in a bulleted list instead."
