  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question about demonstrating quantum advantage without structure, specifically focusing on NP search problems and cryptographic primitives."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the main contributions and findings of the paper, including the construction of NP search problems with quantum speedups, cryptographic separations, proofs of quantumness, and certifiable randomness, all relative to random oracles without strong assumptions. It also correctly mentions the use of Reed-Solomon codes."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses key terms like 'quantum advantage,' 'random oracles,' 'NP search problems,' 'cryptographic primitives,' 'proofs of quantumness,' and 'certifiable randomness.' While it introduces these terms, it does not explain them in detail, which is acceptable given the prompt's constraints. The coherence is good, with distinct sections for each main contribution."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt asked for a summary in *5 sentences*. The provided summary is presented in a bulleted list format, which is significantly longer and does not adhere to the sentence constraint. It is essentially an outline rather than a concise summary."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the major relevant aspects of the paper: the core problem, the main results (NP search, crypto separations, quantumness proofs, randomness), and the technical approach. No irrelevant information is included."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the content of the paper and does not introduce any unsupported claims or information."
  },
  "total_score": 48,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is factually accurate and comprehensive in covering the key contributions of the paper. However, it completely fails to adhere to the prompt's constraint of providing the summary in exactly 5 sentences, opting for a detailed bulleted outline instead."
