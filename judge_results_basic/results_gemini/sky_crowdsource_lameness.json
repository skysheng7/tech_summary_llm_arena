  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research question of the paper: investigating the reliability and scalability of a crowdsourced, comparative lameness assessment method for dairy cattle."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All factual claims made in the summary, such as the use of crowd workers, the comparison method, the agreement with experienced assessors, and the suggested number of workers, are directly supported by the text."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'crowdsourced,' 'comparative lameness assessment,' and 'experienced assessors' coherently. It implicitly explains 'crowdsourcing' by mentioning Amazon Mechanical Turk and 'comparative' by describing the side-by-side video comparison. It could benefit from a brief explanation of 'ICC' if it were more technical."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is precisely 5 sentences long, directly adhering to the prompt's length constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most critical aspects of the study: the method, the findings (agreement with experts, number of workers needed), and the implications (generating data for automation, earlier detection)."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "There are no unsupported claims or information that is not present in the original paper."
  },
  "total_score": 57,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent, accurately reflecting the study's core research question, methodology, and key findings within the strict sentence limit. Its strength lies in its conciseness and the clear articulation of the paper's implications for lameness detection in dairy farming."
