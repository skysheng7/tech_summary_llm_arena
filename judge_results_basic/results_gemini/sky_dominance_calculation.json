  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the central research question: how competition levels influence dominance hierarchies in dairy cows."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements in the summary are factually accurate and directly supported by the text. Key findings such as hierarchy flattening, increased 2-way dyads, and the role of resource valuation are correctly presented."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses key terms like 'dominance hierarchy,' 'feeder occupancy,' and '2-way dyads' effectively. It also explains the concept of resource valuation overriding intrinsic attributes, making the findings coherent."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, directly adhering to the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the most critical findings of the study: the relationship between competition and hierarchy structure, the mechanism (subordinates challenging dominants, 2-way dyads), the underlying reason (resource valuation), and the main recommendation."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not contain any information not present in the original paper."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent, accurately reflecting the core findings and implications of the research within the specified sentence limit. It effectively communicates the study's main contributions and recommendations."
