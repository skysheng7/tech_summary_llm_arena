  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately identifies the central research question: developing a fast and efficient algorithm for community detection in large networks, specifically focusing on modularity optimization."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the text. It correctly describes the algorithm's phases, its performance metrics (speed, quality), and its applications."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses technical terms like 'modularity optimization,' 'hierarchical structure,' and 'meta-communities' without explicit definition, assuming the reader's familiarity. However, it uses them coherently within the context of community detection."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary consists of exactly 5 sentences, perfectly adhering to the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most crucial aspects of the paper: the algorithm's novelty, its methodology (two phases, modularity optimization, hierarchy), its key advantages (speed, quality), and its validation on large networks. It is highly relevant to the paper's content."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "There are no unsupported claims or information not present in the original paper. The summary accurately reflects the paper's findings and contributions."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that perfectly follows the prompt's length constraint. It accurately captures the paper's core contribution, methodology, and advantages, providing a concise yet comprehensive overview of the research."
