  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the core research question of the paper, which is to propose and validate a new method for lameness assessment in dairy cows using crowd-sourced pairwise comparisons to build a lameness hierarchy."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical values and findings presented in the summary (e.g., ICC scores, number of workers, percentage of comparisons) are consistent with the information provided in the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses relevant technical terms like 'lameness hierarchy', 'pairwise comparisons', 'gait scoring', and 'inter-observer reliability' appropriately. The explanation of the pairwise assessment method is coherent and understandable in the context of the summary."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, directly adhering to the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most critical aspects of the study: the proposed method, its comparison to traditional methods, the involvement of crowd workers, the efficiency findings (number of workers/comparisons), and the overall implications for automated lameness detection."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the information presented in the original research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that accurately and concisely captures the essence of the research paper. It effectively communicates the novel approach, its validation, and its advantages over traditional methods within the strict sentence limit, making it highly informative and well-written."
