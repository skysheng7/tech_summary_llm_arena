  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies and articulates the core research contributions and questions addressed by the paper."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the main findings and techniques discussed in the paper, including the types of problems addressed, the cryptographic primitives, and the underlying technical approach."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses key technical terms like 'random oracles,' 'NP search problems,' 'one-way functions,' 'collision-resistant,' 'proofs of quantumness,' and 'certifiable randomness.' While it doesn't define them, their usage within the context of the results provides some coherence. However, terms like 'folded Reed-Solomon codes' and 'list-recoverability' could benefit from a brief explanation for a broader audience."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a summary of '5 sentences'. The provided summary is structured as an introduction followed by five numbered points, making it significantly longer than the requested format."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the main results and the technical approach. However, by breaking the results into five distinct points, it deviates from the requested 5-sentence format, which would naturally limit the detail and scope of coverage. The lack of explicit connection to the Aaronson-Ambainis conjecture within the numbered points could be slightly improved."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the content of the provided paper and does not contain any unsupported or fabricated information."
  },
  "total_score": 43,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary accurately captures the key contributions of the paper, presenting the main results and the technical approach clearly. However, it fails to adhere to the prompt's constraint of a 5-sentence summary, instead opting for a more detailed, point-based format."
