This systematic review examines the use of exoskeletons combined with virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), or gamification for stroke patient rehabilitation. The study found that these combined technologies show promise in improving motor function and increasing patient engagement. While many studies focused on upper limb rehabilitation, there is a notable gap in research for lower limb applications and home-based rehabilitation. The review identified a need for more customizable games and an exploration of AR's potential in this field. Ultimately, the article highlights the growing role of interactive technologies in stroke rehabilitation and the challenges in transitioning these therapies to home settings.
