This study developed and validated the PRECISE-X model to predict the risk of a first severe COPD exacerbation in newly diagnosed patients. Using a large UK cohort, the model incorporates demographics, spirometry, and other clinical factors to provide a risk score at diagnosis. The PRECISE-X model demonstrated strong predictive accuracy and calibration, supporting earlier identification of high-risk individuals. This tool can facilitate proactive and personalized COPD management, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare burden. Further external validation is needed to confirm its generalizability to other healthcare systems and populations.
