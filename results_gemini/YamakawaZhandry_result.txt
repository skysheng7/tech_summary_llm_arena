Here's a summary of the article in five sentences:

This paper presents new theoretical results demonstrating quantum advantage for problems that are not NP-complete, offering a weaker assumption for quantum speedups than previously known. The authors show how random oracles can provide unconditional proofs of quantumness and also construct counterexamples of cryptographic primitives that are secure against classical algorithms but insecure against quantum ones. These constructions are achieved using error-correcting codes and leveraging quantum Fourier transforms, with some results conditional on the Aaronson-Ambainis conjecture. The paper also instantiates these theoretical models with standard cryptographic hash functions like SHA2, suggesting practical implications for new cryptographic constructions. Ultimately, the work challenges the notion that significant "structure" is always required for quantum advantage and explores the separation between classical and quantum random oracle models.
