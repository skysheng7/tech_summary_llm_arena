  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately identifies the main research question, which is to present a new, fast, and scalable algorithm for community detection in large networks that can uncover hierarchical structures."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary correctly describes the two-phase approach and the goal of optimizing modularity. However, the algorithm is not referred to as 'CNM' in the paper, and while the paper mentions applying it to social networks and random graphs, it does not explicitly state 'Erdös-Rényi random graph' as a test case. The paper also mentions it is not limited by computation time but rather storage capacity. The summary states the algorithm is 'fast and efficient' which is true, but it misses the nuance about storage capacity being the primary limitation for very large datasets."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses relevant terms like 'community detection', 'hierarchical community structures', and 'modularity'. The explanation of the two-phase approach is coherent and understandable, despite the minor inaccuracy in naming the algorithm."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, adhering perfectly to the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the core aspects of the paper: the new algorithm, its hierarchical nature, its application to real-world networks, and its performance metrics (speed, accuracy, scalability). However, it omits the crucial detail that storage capacity is the main bottleneck for extremely large networks, not computation time."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary hallucinates the name 'CNM' for the algorithm. It also misrepresents the type of random graph tested and the primary limitation of the algorithm for very large networks (stating computation time as the limitation rather than storage capacity)."
  },
  "total_score": 48,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary effectively captures the essence of the paper, highlighting the novel algorithm and its capabilities in detecting hierarchical communities in large networks. It follows the sentence count constraint perfectly. However, it contains minor factual inaccuracies regarding the algorithm's name, specific test cases, and the nature of its primary limitation for massive datasets."
