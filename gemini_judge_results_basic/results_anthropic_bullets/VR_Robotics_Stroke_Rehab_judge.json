  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question: evaluating the effectiveness of VR-based robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation in stroke patients."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical data (participant numbers, duration, improvements) and qualitative findings are accurately represented from the original text."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses technical terms like 'hemiplegia', 'FMA-LE', 'BBS', 'FAC', 'MoCA', 'SS-QoL-12' without explicit explanation, which is acceptable given the target audience of a research paper. However, a brief mention of what these measure would enhance clarity for a broader audience."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary is presented as a bulleted list and exceeds the 5-sentence limit of the original prompt. It was not a 5-sentence summary."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers most key aspects: study design, participants, interventions, key results for motor function, safety, and conclusions. However, it omits the detailed breakdown of secondary outcomes and specific numerical differences for all measures, and the discussion on limitations and future research is only briefly touched upon. The bullet point format also inherently makes it less of a cohesive summary."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary strictly adheres to the information presented in the research paper and does not introduce any unsupported claims."
  },
  "total_score": 43,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary accurately reflects the study's findings and methodology. However, it failed to adhere to the 5-sentence constraint of the original prompt, presenting the information in a bulleted list format instead, which reduces its coherence as a narrative summary."
