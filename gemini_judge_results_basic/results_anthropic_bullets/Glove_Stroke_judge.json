  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the central research question: the therapeutic effects of wearable robotic gloves on hand function in stroke patients."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {

  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate terminology (e.g., 'systematic review', 'randomized controlled trials', 'spasticity') and presents the information coherently. While it lists device names, it doesn't explain what they are, which is acceptable for a concise summary but could be slightly improved."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary is presented in bullet points, not in 5 sentences as requested by the prompt. This is a significant deviation from the prompt's instructions."
  },

    "reasoning": "The summary covers all key aspects of the paper, including the methodology, results, limitations, and conclusions, making it highly relevant and comprehensive."

  },
  "total_score": 49,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is excellent in terms of accuracy, completeness, and relevance, providing a thorough overview of the research. However, it fails to adhere to the prompt's constraint of a 5-sentence format, opting for a bulleted list instead."
