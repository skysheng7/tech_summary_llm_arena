  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question of the paper: how to prepare high-quality initial states for quantum chemistry simulations and energy estimation."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key contributions of the paper, including the novel SOS algorithm, the energy distribution framework, and the concept of Goldilocks problems. The complexity analysis of O(D log D) for the SOS algorithm is correct. The only minor point is the lack of precise sentence count, which is addressed in prompt following."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Key terms like 'initial states', 'quantum chemistry', 'sum-of-Slater-determinants (SOS)', 'energy distribution', 'QPE leakage', and 'Goldilocks problems' are mentioned and their role is implicitly or explicitly explained within the context of the workflow. The workflow itself is coherent."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a summary in 5 sentences. The provided summary is a detailed bulleted list and significantly exceeds the requested sentence count and format."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the main technical contributions and numerical demonstrations. However, it's presented as a detailed outline rather than a concise summary, making it less a summary and more an extended abstract. The bullet points provide more detail than a typical 5-sentence summary would allow."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the provided text. No unsupported or fabricated information is present."
  },
  "total_score": 43,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is factually accurate and captures the essential contributions of the paper, including technical details and concepts. However, it completely fails to adhere to the prompt's requirement of a 5-sentence summary, instead providing a detailed bulleted outline."
