  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research question: demonstrating quantum advantage for non-NP-complete problems under weaker assumptions and exploring the implications for cryptography and quantum/classical random oracle models."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the main contributions: quantum advantage for non-NP-complete problems, unconditional proofs of quantumness, counterexamples for cryptographic primitives, use of error-correcting codes and QFT, instantiation with hash functions, and the challenge to the 'structure' requirement. It also correctly mentions the reliance on the Aaronson-Ambainis conjecture for some results."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses technical terms like 'quantum advantage,' 'random oracles,' 'proofs of quantumness,' 'counterexamples of cryptographic primitives,' 'error-correcting codes,' 'quantum Fourier transforms,' and 'Aaronson-Ambainis conjecture.' While these terms are essential, they are not explicitly explained, relying on the reader's prior knowledge for full coherence. The flow between sentences is good."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, directly fulfilling the prompt's requirement."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most important aspects of the paper, including the theoretical findings, cryptographic implications, technical tools used, practical instantiations, and the broader conceptual contribution. It prioritizes the most relevant information for a concise overview."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is well-grounded in the content of the paper and does not contain any unsupported or fabricated claims."
  },
  "total_score": 54,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that effectively captures the paper's core contributions within the strict sentence limit. It accurately highlights the theoretical advancements, cryptographic implications, and the underlying technical approaches, while also mentioning the reliance on specific conjectures and practical instantiations."
