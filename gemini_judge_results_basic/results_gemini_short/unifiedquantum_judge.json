  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research question: to generalize and unify existing 'no-go' theorems in quantum mechanics, specifically those related to state transformations and superposition, and to develop new schemes based on these principles."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key concepts presented in the paper, including the 'no-encoding' theorem, the unification of existing no-go theorems, the role of linear independence, and the development of new superposing schemes."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate technical terms like 'no-go' theorems, 'no-cloning', 'no-deleting', 'superposition principle', 'Hilbert space', 'universal quantum transformation', and 'linear independence'. The terms are used coherently within the context of the research."

    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, as requested by the prompt."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the main contributions of the paper: the new theorems, the unification of existing ones, the schemes for quantum tasks, and the new superposing schemes, all of which are highly relevant to the research presented."
