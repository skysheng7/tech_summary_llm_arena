  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the core research question of the paper, which is to review and categorize studies on exoskeleton-based rehabilitation combined with VR, AR, or gamification for stroke patients."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reports the number of studies reviewed (30), the publication years (2010-2017), the total number of participants (approx. 385), the focus on upper limb rehabilitation (28 studies), the most popular devices, the frequency of VR/gamification use, the general findings of improvement and increased motivation, and the disparity between clinic-based and home-based rehabilitation."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'exoskeletons,' 'virtual reality (VR),' 'augmented reality (AR),' and 'gamification' appropriately. While these terms are not explicitly defined, they are used within a clear context that allows for understanding, especially given the nature of the paper. The coherence is excellent."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is precisely 5 sentences long, directly fulfilling the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most critical aspects of the paper: the scope of the review, key findings regarding rehabilitation focus, devices, technologies, outcomes (improvements, motivation), the gap in home-based rehabilitation, and future research directions. All points are highly relevant to the paper's objectives."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the content of the original paper and does not introduce any unsubstantiated claims or information not present in the text."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that precisely follows the prompt's instructions and accurately captures the key findings and implications of the research paper. It is well-structured, factually accurate, and highly relevant."
