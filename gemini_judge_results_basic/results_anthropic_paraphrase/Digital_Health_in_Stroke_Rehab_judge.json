{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the core research question of the paper, which is to explore the use of DHTs for stroke rehabilitation in Canada, identify gaps, and inform future decisions."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately presents the numerical data regarding the number of studies, the percentage of focus on upper extremity function, the phase of stroke, and the settings where studies were conducted. It also correctly identifies the types of technologies used."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses relevant terminology such as 'Digital Health Technologies (DHTs)', 'scoping review', 'randomized controlled trials', and lists specific technologies like 'virtual reality' and 'telerehabilitation'. While it doesn't explicitly define each term, the context makes them largely understandable. The coherence is good, flowing logically from findings to identified gaps and recommendations."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. Option 1 has 10 sentences, Option 2 has 10 sentences, and Option 3 is incomplete. None of the options adhere to the sentence limit."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the main aspects of the paper: the scope of the review, the key findings regarding technology use, outcomes, facilitators, barriers, identified gaps (especially lack of focus on lower limb, cognition, ADLs, mental health, and earlier phases), and recommendations for future research. It is highly relevant to the original paper."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All information presented in the summary is directly supported by the text of the original research paper. There are no unsupported claims or fabricated details."
  },
  "total_score": 46,
  "overall_assessment": "The summaries are comprehensive and accurately reflect the key findings, gaps, and recommendations of the research paper, demonstrating excellent completeness and factual accuracy. However, they significantly fail to adhere to the prompt's strict 5-sentence limit, rendering them unsuitable as direct answers to the specific request."
