  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the central research question of the review, which is to investigate the therapeutic effects of wearable robotic gloves on improving hand function in stroke patients."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings, including the number of studies included (5), the range of participants (3-13), the lack of RCTs, the focus on chronic stroke patients with mild to moderate spasticity, and the quality scores (7-10/12). It also correctly lists the five robotic glove technologies mentioned."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate terminology related to stroke rehabilitation and robotic devices. While terms like 'spasticity' and 'RCTs' are used, they are contextually understandable within the summary. The coherence is excellent, flowing logically from the review's purpose to its findings and conclusions."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is 7 sentences long, exceeding the requested 5 sentences."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is comprehensive, covering the main aspects of the systematic review: the objective, methodology (search scope, number of studies), key findings (therapeutic effects, limitations), specific devices, intervention characteristics, and the final recommendations for future research. All points are highly relevant to the original paper."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is well-supported by the text and does not introduce any unsupported claims or fabricated information."
  },
  "total_score": 54,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary effectively captures the essence of the systematic review, accurately detailing its methodology, findings, and limitations. Its main weakness is exceeding the requested sentence count, but otherwise, it is a well-written and informative synopsis of the paper."
