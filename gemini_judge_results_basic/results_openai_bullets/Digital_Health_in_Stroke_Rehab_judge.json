  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the core research questions of the paper, which are about the use of DHTs in Canada, identifying gaps, and informing future decisions."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately presents the key findings and statistics from the paper, including the number of studies, publication years, types of studies, focus areas, technologies, and findings regarding feasibility, effectiveness, and barriers."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses technical terms like 'scoping review,' 'DHTs,' 'RCTs,' and mentions specific technologies like 'VR,' 'telerehabilitation,' and 'robotic devices.' While these are key terms, they are not explicitly explained within the summary itself. However, the context provided makes them generally understandable to someone familiar with the field."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is presented as a bulleted list and contains far more than 5 distinct points, violating the sentence count constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the essential aspects of the paper, including the background, methods (briefly), results (study characteristics, technologies, findings, barriers), and conclusions/future directions. It is highly relevant to the paper's content."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary strictly adheres to the information presented in the original paper. There are no unsupported claims or information not found in the source material."
  },
  "total_score": 46,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is comprehensive and factually accurate, capturing the key findings and conclusions of the research paper effectively. However, it completely fails to adhere to the prompt's constraint of providing a 5-sentence summary, instead presenting a detailed bulleted list which is far too long."
