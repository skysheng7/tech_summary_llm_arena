  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question: developing a novel, more reliable, and scalable method for lameness assessment in dairy cows, moving away from traditional subjective methods towards a crowd-sourced, pairwise comparison approach."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical values, such as ICC scores (0.81, 0.62, 0.44, 0.85), reduction in comparisons (61%), and number of crowd workers (8), are accurately reflected from the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Key terms like 'pairwise comparison', 'lameness hierarchy', 'EloSteepness', and 'ICC' are used accurately in context. The summary flows well, connecting the proposed method to its benefits and findings."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is presented as a bulleted list containing 13 distinct points, exceeding the requested sentence limit significantly."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the essential aspects of the paper, including the problem statement, proposed methodology, key findings (reliability of experts vs. crowd, comparison metrics), efficiency gains through subsampling, and the overall conclusion regarding its utility for automated model training."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All information presented in the summary is directly supported by the content of the original research paper. There are no unsupported claims or fabricated details."
  },
  "total_score": 54,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is highly informative and factually accurate, covering all crucial aspects of the research. However, it fails to adhere to the prompt's constraint of a 5-sentence limit, presenting a much more detailed bulleted list instead."
