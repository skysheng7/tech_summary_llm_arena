  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question: how competition intensity affects dairy cow dominance hierarchies."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical data and key findings presented in the summary are accurately reflected from the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Key terms like 'dominance hierarchies,' 'replacement events,' 'feeder occupancy,' and 'Elo-based hierarchies' are used and understood in context. The explanation of 'two-way dyads' is also clear."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The original prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary, even when converted to bullet points, contains significantly more than 5 distinct points, failing to adhere to the sentence limit."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the main aspects of the study, including the methodology, key findings regarding hierarchy flattening, two-way dyads, and the implications for dominance assessment. It is highly relevant to the paper's content."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "There are no unsupported claims or information not present in the original article."
