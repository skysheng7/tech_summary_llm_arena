{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question: developing a fast and accurate method for community detection in large networks, specifically by optimizing modularity and handling scalability issues."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key contributions and findings of the paper, including the two-phase iterative algorithm, its efficiency, scalability, and application results."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Key terms like 'modularity optimization', 'heuristic', 'pass', 'meta-network', and 'multi-resolution partitions' are used appropriately and their context within the algorithm is clear. The explanation of the two phases is coherent. A slight improvement could be a brief definition of modularity itself, but its role in the algorithm is well-explained."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The prompt asked for a summary in 5 sentences. The provided summary uses bullet points and significantly more than 5 distinct informational points, effectively exceeding the sentence limit. While it captures the essence, it does not adhere to the sentence constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is comprehensive in covering the main aspects of the paper: the proposed method, its advantages (speed, scalability), its performance compared to others, and a real-world application example. All points are highly relevant to the paper's contribution."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is entirely based on the content of the provided paper and does not introduce any unsupported claims or external information."
  },
  "total_score": 50,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary effectively captures the core contributions, methodology, and results of the research paper, highlighting its strengths in speed and scalability for community detection. However, it fails to adhere to the prompt's strict sentence limit by presenting the information in a bulleted list with numerous points, rather than a concise 5-sentence narrative."
