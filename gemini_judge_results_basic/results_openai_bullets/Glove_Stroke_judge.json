{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question of the paper, which is the therapeutic effect of wearable robotic gloves on hand function in stroke patients."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical data (e.g., number of records, number of studies, participant numbers, quality score range) and descriptive findings (e.g., types of devices, intervention characteristics, study limitations) presented in the summary are accurate according to the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate technical terms from the paper (e.g., 'systematic review', 'wearable robotic gloves', 'stroke', 'methodological quality', 'randomized controlled trials'). While it does not explicitly explain every term, it uses them in a coherent context that is understandable to someone familiar with the field. Some terms like EPHO, PneuGlove, X-Glove, HandinMind, and IronHand are presented as names of devices without further explanation, which is acceptable given the context of a summary."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt specifically asked for a summary in '5 sentences'. The provided summary is presented as a list of bullet points, containing significantly more than 5 distinct pieces of information, failing to adhere to the sentence count constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures all the key aspects of the paper, including the objective, methodology, number of studies included, participant characteristics, findings, limitations, and conclusions. It prioritizes the most relevant information for understanding the study's contribution."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the content of the original paper without introducing any unsupported claims or fabricated information."
  },
  "total_score": 48,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is highly comprehensive and factually accurate, covering all essential aspects of the research paper. However, it completely fails to adhere to the prompt's request for a 5-sentence summary, instead presenting the information as a detailed list."
