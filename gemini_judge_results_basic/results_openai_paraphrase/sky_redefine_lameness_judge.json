  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research question of the paper, which is to develop and validate a novel, crowd-sourced method for lameness assessment in dairy cows using a lameness hierarchy."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings, including the high inter-observer reliability for the proposed method (ICC=0.81 and ICC=0.85) and the lower reliability of traditional gait scoring (ICC around 0.62 and 0.44). The numbers cited for subsampling (8 workers, 61% reduction) are also correct. A slight deduction is made as it does not mention the exact number of videos (30) used in the pilot study explicitly, though it is implied by the context of video pairs."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses key terms like 'lameness hierarchy,' 'pairwise comparisons,' 'EloSteepness,' and 'ICC' appropriately. It also explains that the new method moves away from 'subjective 5-point scales' to a 'continuous' system, which provides good coherence. The explanation of EloSteepness as a 'Bayesian Elo-based methodology' is sufficient in this context."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The provided summary, despite the prompt asking for 5 sentences, is presented in a significantly longer format. It contains many more than 5 sentences, failing to adhere to the length constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the most critical aspects of the paper: the problem statement (subjectivity of current methods), the proposed solution (crowd-sourced pairwise comparisons for a lameness hierarchy), the methodology (EloSteepness, MTurk), the key findings (high reliability of the new method, lower reliability of old methods, effectiveness of crowd workers, subsampling efficiency), and the conclusion (economical and reliable data generation for automated models). It is highly relevant and comprehensive for a summary."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary appears to be entirely based on the provided text. All claims and figures presented are directly supported by the original paper, and there are no instances of fabricated information."
  },
  "total_score": 47,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary excels in its factual accuracy, completeness, and clarity of technical terms, effectively conveying the core findings and significance of the research. However, it significantly fails to adhere to the prompt's explicit request for a 5-sentence summary, being substantially longer."
