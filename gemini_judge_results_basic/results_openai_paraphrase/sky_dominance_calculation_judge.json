  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the central research question of how competition levels affect dominance hierarchies in dairy cows, as inferred from feeder replacement data."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings of the study, including the methodology (sensor data, feeder occupancy, Elo ratings), the observed trend of hierarchy flattening with increased competition, the increase in 2-way dyads, and the implications of high feed desirability."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate terminology like 'dominance hierarchy,' 'feeder occupancy,' 'replacement occurrences,' and 'Elo-based hierarchies.' The concepts are explained coherently within the context of the study, making it understandable."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary provided is significantly longer than the requested 5 sentences. It contains 6 sentences."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is highly relevant to the paper's core findings and methodology. It covers the main aspects: the study's objective, how competition was measured, the primary results regarding hierarchy steepness and dyadic interactions, and the concluding interpretation of resource valuation over intrinsic dominance."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the text of the research paper. There are no unsupported or fabricated statements."
  },
  "total_score": 50,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary effectively captures the essence of the research paper, detailing the methodology, key findings, and conclusions with clarity and accuracy. Its primary drawback is its length, exceeding the requested sentence limit by one sentence."
