  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,

  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary explains key terms like 'estimand' and 'clinical relevance' well. It maintains good coherence, though the detailed breakdown of all twelve days is extensive for a 5-sentence summary."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is significantly longer than the requested 5 sentences. It appears to have been generated as a detailed summary rather than a concise one."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "While the summary covers the main themes and many specific examples of statistical issues, its length means it includes more detail than a 5-sentence summary would typically allow, making it less concise than ideal for the prompt."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All information presented in the summary is directly derived from the provided article."
  },
  "total_score": 44,
