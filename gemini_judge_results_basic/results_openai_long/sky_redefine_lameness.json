  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core problem (difficulty in lameness detection, limitations of current methods) and the proposed solution (pairwise comparison and lameness hierarchy using crowd-sourcing)."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical values and descriptions of methods and findings appear to be accurately extracted from the provided text."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Key terms like 'subjective gait scoring', 'low reliability', 'pairwise comparison task', 'continuous lameness ranking', and 'EloSteepness' are well-explained or contextualized. The flow is coherent and logical, making the concepts easy to understand."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is structured into sections (Problem, Proposed approach, Data, Key findings, Conclusions, Limitations) rather than a single 5-sentence narrative. While it contains all the necessary information, it does not strictly adhere to the 5-sentence limit or format."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all essential aspects of the paper, from the problem definition and proposed solution to the methodology, key findings (including quantitative results), conclusions, and limitations. The information is highly relevant to understanding the research."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims and data presented in the summary are directly supported by the provided research paper text."
  },
  "total_score": 54,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent in its content, accuracy, and explanation of technical terms, effectively conveying the research's core message and findings. However, it fails to strictly adhere to the 5-sentence limit, opting for a structured, sectioned format instead."
