  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the research question: to investigate the effectiveness and safety of VR-based robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation in stroke patients with hemiplegia."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the study design, participant numbers, intervention details, and key findings, including specific scores and p-values. All numerical data presented in the summary aligns with the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses technical terms appropriately (e.g., hemiplegia, VR, FMA-LE, BBS, FAC, MoCA) and provides brief explanations for some, like hemiplegia and the assessment scales. The flow is generally coherent, though the sentence structure is somewhat verbose due to the prompt's requirement to 'expand with restated ideas and redundant explanations'."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is significantly longer, consisting of multiple paragraphs and an estimated 20+ sentences. The instruction to 'expand with restated ideas and redundant explanations' also deviates from a concise summary."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the essential aspects of the research: the background, methodology, key findings (both primary and secondary outcomes, including lack of effect on cognitive function), safety, and conclusions/recommendations. It remains highly relevant to the original paper."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the content of the paper and does not introduce any unsupported or fabricated information."
  },
  "total_score": 49,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary accurately and comprehensively captures the essence of the research paper, including its methodology, findings, and conclusions. However, it significantly fails to adhere to the prompt's explicit sentence count of five, instead providing a much longer, more detailed, and intentionally verbose explanation."
