{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies and restates the central research question about how competition intensity affects dairy cow dominance hierarchies, derived from feed bunk interactions."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings, including the inverse relationship between feeder occupancy and hierarchy steepness, the increase in 2-way dyads, and the observation of dominant cows losing more often under high competition. Numerical details mentioned in the original paper (e.g., 48 cows, 159 total cows, 25 levels of occupancy, Elo rating system) are correctly represented."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary explains terms like 'replacement' and 'feeder occupancy' well. It also coherently explains the Elo rating system's role. The language is generally clear, though some phrasing is slightly verbose and could be more concise."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The original prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. This summary is significantly longer, exceeding 15 sentences and including extensive restatements and redundant explanations. It completely disregards the sentence limit."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the most critical aspects of the paper: the research question, methodology (dynamic group, feeder occupancy, Elo ratings, 25 levels), key findings (flattening hierarchy, 2-way dyads, dominant cows losing more), and the proposed conclusion about resource valuation overriding intrinsic attributes. It is highly relevant."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the content of the provided paper and does not introduce any unsupported claims or information not present in the original text."
  },
  "total_score": 49,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary excels in its comprehensive coverage of the research, accurate factual representation, and clear explanation of key concepts. However, it fails entirely to adhere to the prompt's strict 5-sentence limit, making it excessively verbose and repetitive."
