  "research_question": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary is a response to a missing article, so it doesn't address any research question."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately states that no article was provided. There are no factual claims about a non-existent article to verify."

  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is perfectly coherent and uses clear language. No technical terminology is used as no article was provided."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt asked for a summary of a provided article. Since no article was provided, a summary could not be generated, thus the prompt was not followed."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary is incomplete as it cannot summarize an article that was not provided. It is not relevant to the content of any research paper."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not hallucinate any information about the content of a research paper because no paper was provided."
  },
  "total_score": 20,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary correctly identifies that no article was provided, which is its primary function. However, it fails to fulfill the core request of summarizing an article, making it inherently incomplete and irrelevant to the intended task."
