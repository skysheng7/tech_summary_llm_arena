  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately identifies the central research question: the therapeutic effects of wearable robotic gloves on hand function in stroke patients."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the findings of the review, including the positive effects observed, the limitations of existing research (e.g., sample size, methodological quality, lack of standardization), and the need for further studies. It correctly notes that the reviewed studies focused on improvement in hand movement and strength, and that spasticity was a consideration."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate terminology like 'robotic gloves', 'hand function', 'stroke patients', 'spasticity', and 'methodological quality' without over-explaining, maintaining coherence. The flow between sentences is logical."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, directly adhering to the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main points of the article: the identified benefits, the limitations of current research, and the call for future studies. It omits some specific details like the number of studies reviewed or the names of specific devices, which is appropriate for a concise summary."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary only includes information present in the original article and does not introduce any unsupported claims or fabricated details."
