  "research_question": {
    "score": 6,
    "reasoning": "The summary identifies the core issue of AI silencing controversial realities and perpetuating misinformation, but it doesn't explicitly state the specific research question about livestock farming or prompt revision, which is central to the paper."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The statements made in the summary are factually accurate according to the provided text. It correctly identifies that AI can reflect biases, amplify them, and reinforce power structures."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'controversial realities,' 'misinformation,' 'societal biases,' and 'power structures' coherently. However, it doesn't explain specific technical terms used in the paper like 'prompt revision,' 'generative AI,' or 'text-to-image models' which would have improved coherence."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, directly adhering to the prompt's length constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is too general. While it accurately captures the overarching theme of AI bias and misinformation, it completely omits the specific focus of the paper: intensive livestock farming and the role of prompt revision in DALL-E 3. This makes the summary less relevant to the detailed findings of the research."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not contain any information that is not supported by the provided text."
  },
  "total_score": 44,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary accurately captures the general theme of AI bias and misinformation, and it perfectly follows the sentence count constraint. However, it lacks specificity regarding the paper's core focus on livestock farming and prompt revision, making it a less complete and relevant summary of the research presented."
