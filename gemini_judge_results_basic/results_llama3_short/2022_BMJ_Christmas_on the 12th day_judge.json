  "research_question": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary touches upon the core theme of improving research methods and reporting in clinical trials, particularly for prognosis and prediction models, but doesn't explicitly state a single, focused research question that the article itself might be trying to answer or explore. It leans more towards a descriptive overview of the article's content."
