  "research_question": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The provided summary does not address any research question from the paper. Instead, it discusses the input format and the inability to summarize it."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately describes the provided text as a collection of bibliographical entries and links, rather than a coherent narrative suitable for summarization. This assessment is factually correct."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'bibliographical entries,' 'attribution,' and 'academic publication' correctly. It coherently explains why summarization is difficult due to the input's format. However, it does not explain any technical terms from the original research paper."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary fails to provide a 5-sentence summary of the article. Instead, it explains why it cannot perform the requested summarization."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary is not relevant to the research content of the paper itself, as it focuses entirely on the format of the input and the inability to summarize it. It does not cover any findings, methods, or conclusions of the research."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not hallucinate any information related to the research content of the paper. Its statements are about the input format, which are accurate."
  },
  "total_score": 18,
  "overall_assessment": "The provided summary completely fails to address the prompt by not summarizing the research paper. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the format of the input text and stating its inability to generate a summary. While its assessment of the input is accurate, it completely misses the core requirement of the prompt."
