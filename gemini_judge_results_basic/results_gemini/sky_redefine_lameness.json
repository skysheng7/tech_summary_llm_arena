  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately identifies the core research question: developing a novel, reliable, and efficient method for lameness assessment in dairy cows using crowd-sourced data and pairwise comparisons to construct a lameness hierarchy."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements in the summary are factually supported by the original paper. Key findings such as high inter-observer reliability, feasibility for crowd workers, and the effectiveness of the subsampling algorithm are correctly represented."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'lameness hierarchy', 'pairwise comparisons', and 'crowd-sourced data' appropriately. While 'EloSteepness' and 'ICC' are key terms in the paper, they are not explicitly defined in the summary, which is acceptable given the sentence limit. The overall coherence is excellent."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary consists of exactly 5 sentences, directly adhering to the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the most crucial aspects of the paper, including the proposed method, its validation with crowd workers, the efficiency gains, and its implications for future research and applications. It is highly relevant to the paper's content."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not contain any unsupported claims or information not present in the original paper."
  },
  "total_score": 58,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that precisely follows the prompt's instructions. It accurately captures the core research question, key findings, and implications of the study within the strict sentence limit, demonstrating a strong understanding of the paper's content."
