  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research question of the paper, which is to review the practices and technologies implemented in post-stroke rehabilitation using exoskeletons combined with VR, AR, or gamification."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings of the paper, including the focus on upper limb rehabilitation, the gap in lower limb research, the effectiveness of the technologies, and the challenges in home-based rehabilitation."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses key terms like 'exoskeletons', 'virtual reality (VR)', 'augmented reality (AR)', and 'gamification' appropriately and coherently within the context of rehabilitation. No specialized terms were left unexplained that would hinder understanding."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, directly adhering to the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most critical aspects of the paper, including the research scope, key findings (upper vs. lower limb, home-based therapy), benefits, and future directions. It omits detailed methodology and specific examples of devices, which is appropriate for a concise summary."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the original paper. There are no unsupported or fabricated statements."
