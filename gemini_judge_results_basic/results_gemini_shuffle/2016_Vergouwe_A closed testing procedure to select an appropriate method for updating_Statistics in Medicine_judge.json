{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the paper's primary goal: to propose and evaluate a closed testing procedure for selecting an appropriate method to update prediction models."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key aspects of the paper, including the proposed procedure, its purpose (preventing overfitting, balancing update needs), the sequential testing of methods, and the use of clinical examples."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses relevant technical terms like 'closed testing procedure,' 'updating,' 'overfitting,' 'recalibration in the large,' and 'model revision' coherently. While it doesn't explicitly define them, their context within the summary makes their meaning understandable to someone familiar with the field."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is precisely 5 sentences long, directly fulfilling the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most crucial elements: the problem addressed, the proposed solution (closed testing procedure), its core mechanism (sequential testing, balancing update vs. overfitting), and validation through examples. It is highly relevant to the paper's content."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the original paper. There are no unsupported or fabricated statements."
