  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the core research question: how generative AI (specifically DALL-E 3) presents a biased view of livestock farming due to prompt revision, erasing the realities of intensive practices."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings of the paper, including the default pastoral bias of DALL-E 3, the role of prompt revision in this bias, and the ability of the base model to generate more realistic images when revision is disabled. It also correctly identifies the implications for misinformation and the proposed solutions."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses key terms like 'generative AI,' 'prompt revision,' 'pastoral images,' and 'intensive farming' accurately. The language is coherent and flows well, making the complex topic understandable. The term 'coded gaze' which is central to the paper's discussion on bias shaping is not explicitly mentioned, which slightly reduces coherence with the paper's deeper analysis."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary consists of 5 sentences, adhering to the sentence count constraint. However, the first sentence is a reordered version of the original summary, which was not part of the prompt. Therefore, it's not a direct summary of the *provided* text but a reordered version of it. If it were a direct summary of the text provided, it would be a 10."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most critical aspects of the paper: the problem (bias in AI imagery of livestock farming), the cause (prompt revision), the evidence (DALL-E 3's behavior), the implications (misinformation, hindered dialogue), and the proposed solutions (transparency, disclosure). It is highly relevant to the core research of the paper."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not introduce any unsupported claims or information not present in the original text."
  },
  "total_score": 55,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary effectively captures the essence of the research, clearly outlining the problem of bias in AI-generated livestock imagery due to prompt revision and its implications. While it adheres to the sentence count and is factually accurate, the reordering of the summary before presenting it, and the omission of a key term like 'coded gaze', slightly detract from its perfection."
