{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the central research question of how competition levels influence dominance hierarchies in dairy cows."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All factual claims in the summary align with the information presented in the paper, including the concept of hierarchy flattening, the increase in 2-way dyads, and the influence of resource valuation."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses key terms like 'dominance hierarchy', 'feeder occupancy', and '2-way dyads' coherently. While 'resource valuation' is mentioned, a brief explanation of what it entails (e.g., perceived value of the resource) could enhance clarity for a broader audience, though it is adequately represented within the context of the summary."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, directly addressing the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the main findings and implications of the study, including the research question, key results (hierarchy flattening, 2-way dyads), the underlying mechanism (resource valuation), and the study's recommendation. All points are highly relevant to the paper's core message."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "There are no claims made in the summary that are not supported by the original research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that perfectly follows the prompt's constraints and accurately reflects the core findings and implications of the research paper. It is coherent, factually accurate, and relevant, with only a minor opportunity for enhanced terminology explanation."
