  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question: to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of VR-based robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation in stroke patients with hemiplegia."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings of the study, including the significant improvements in motor function, balancing, walking ability, ADLs, and quality of life in the intervention group, as well as the lack of significant improvement in global cognitive function. It also correctly states the study's conclusion regarding feasibility and the need for further research."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate technical terms from the paper (e.g., 'virtual reality (VR)-based robotic training', 'hemiplegia', 'lower limb motor function', 'global cognitive function', 'activities of daily living'). While not explicitly explaining each term, their context within the summary makes them understandable to someone familiar with the general domain. The bullet points enhance coherence."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is presented as 10 bullet points, which is significantly more than the requested 5 sentences."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the main aspects of the study, including the intervention, key results, and conclusion. However, it could be more concise and integrated into the requested 5 sentences to be more relevant to the prompt. It also repeats points (e.g., 'enhanced balancing function', 'walking ability', 'activities of daily living', 'quality of life' are listed as separate points when they could be consolidated)."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the provided research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 44,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary accurately captures the study's findings and conclusions, demonstrating good factual accuracy and relevance. However, it fails significantly in adhering to the prompt's constraint of providing a 5-sentence summary, instead presenting 10 distinct bullet points."
