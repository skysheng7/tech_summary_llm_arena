  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary introduces the concept of 'stocking fillers' as a framing device and correctly identifies several key statistical issues. However, it does not explain the technical terms themselves, which is understandable given the prompt, but limits the depth of explanation."
