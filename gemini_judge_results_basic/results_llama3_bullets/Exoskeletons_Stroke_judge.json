{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary directly addresses the core research question of the paper by discussing the review's findings on exoskeletons combined with VR, AR, and gamification for stroke rehabilitation."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings, aims, and limitations mentioned in the original paper, such as the focus on motor function, engagement, and the discussion of limitations like small sample sizes."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses the technical terms (VR, AR, gamification, exoskeletons) appropriately and coherently within the context of the research. It does not attempt to explain them but uses them in a way that is understandable given the source material."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt specifically requested a summary in 5 sentences. The provided summary is in bullet points, not sentences, and contains 5 bullet points, but it does not adhere to the sentence format."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "While the summary covers the main points, it is presented as bullet points rather than a coherent summary. It misses the opportunity to connect the ideas into a flowing narrative as requested by the prompt. It also doesn't explicitly mention the systematic review methodology, which is a key aspect of the paper's approach."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All the points made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the original paper."
  },
  "total_score": 45,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary accurately captures the main findings and implications of the research paper regarding the use of technology in stroke rehabilitation. However, it fails to follow the prompt's specific instruction to provide the summary in 5 sentences, opting for bullet points instead, which detracts from its overall usability as a direct answer to the prompt."
