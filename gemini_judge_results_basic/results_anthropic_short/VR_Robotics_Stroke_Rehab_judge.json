  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question: to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of VR-based robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation in stroke patients with hemiplegia."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings and numerical data presented in the paper, including participant numbers, intervention details, and significant outcome differences. For example, the mean differences for motor function (6.5 vs 3.3) are correctly stated."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate technical terms like 'hemiplegia,' 'virtual reality (VR),' 'robotic training,' and 'conventional rehabilitation' without requiring explicit explanation within the summary itself. The flow is coherent and easy to understand."
  },

    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the most critical aspects of the study: the objective, methodology (groups, intervention), key results (both positive and neutral findings), safety, and conclusion/future directions, making it highly complete and relevant."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All information presented in the summary is directly supported by the provided research paper. There are no unsupported claims or fabricated details."
  },
  "total_score": 60,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent, precisely adhering to the prompt's length requirement while accurately and comprehensively capturing the essence of the research paper. It effectively communicates the study's objectives, methods, key findings, and implications."
