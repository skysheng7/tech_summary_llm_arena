  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question: developing a new method for lameness assessment using crowd-sourced pairwise comparisons to create a lameness hierarchy."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reports the key findings, including the low reliability of traditional gait scoring (ICC = 0.44-0.62), high reliability of the proposed pairwise method among experts (ICC = 0.81), agreement between crowd workers and experts (ICC = 0.85), and the minimum required workers and comparisons (8 workers, 37% comparisons)."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses technical terms like 'lameness hierarchy,' 'pairwise comparisons,' and 'ICC' appropriately within the context of the article. The explanation is coherent and easy to understand for someone familiar with research in this area."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, directly adhering to the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most important aspects of the study: the problem addressed, the proposed solution, the comparison with traditional methods, the validation with crowd workers, and the efficiency of the method. All points are highly relevant to the research question."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All information presented in the summary is directly supported by the provided text of the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 60,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent, accurately capturing the essence of the research paper within the strict sentence limit. It effectively communicates the novelty, findings, and implications of the proposed lameness assessment method."
