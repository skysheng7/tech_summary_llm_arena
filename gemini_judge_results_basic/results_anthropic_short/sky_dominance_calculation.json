  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly outlines the research question regarding how dominance hierarchies change with competition levels in dairy cows."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical values and key findings presented in the summary are consistent with the information in the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses technical terms like 'feeder occupancy,' 'dominance hierarchy steepness,' and 'two-way dyads' accurately. While it doesn't explicitly define them, their usage within the context makes them understandable for someone familiar with the field. Explaining 'feeder occupancy' as 'indicating higher competition' is helpful."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, perfectly matching the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively covers the main aspects of the paper: the objective, key findings (including quantitative results), interpretation of those findings, and the authors' recommendations. All points are highly relevant to the study."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the content of the original paper and does not introduce any unsupported claims or information."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent, adhering strictly to the 5-sentence limit and accurately capturing the study's objective, findings, and conclusions. It effectively conveys the core message that increased competition flattens dominance hierarchies in dairy cows, driven by resource valuation."
