{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the core research question of the paper: how text-to-image AI models, specifically DALL-E 3, represent intensive livestock farming and how prompt revision affects this representation."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the findings of the study, including the default pastoral output of DALL-E 3, the effect of prompt revision, the shift to indoor depictions when revision is disabled, and the partial alignment with regional statistics."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate terminology like 'prompt revision,' 'pastoral scenes,' and 'intensive conditions' and explains them through context. The term 'coded gaze' is introduced and its meaning is conveyed. The coherence is excellent."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, fulfilling the prompt's requirement."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most critical aspects of the study: the problem of prompt revision, the nature of the generated images with and without revision, the regional comparison, and the implications of the findings. It is highly relevant to the core findings."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not contain any unsupported claims or fabricated information."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent, accurately capturing the study's main findings and implications within the requested sentence limit. It effectively communicates the core problem of prompt revision in AI generating idealized, misleading representations of intensive livestock farming and the consequences of this bias."
