{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research question of the paper, which is to review and categorize studies on exoskeleton-based rehabilitation combined with VR, AR, or gamification, and to assess their effectiveness."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical and categorical data presented in the summary (e.g., number of studies, participant count, publication years, limb focus, number of studies using VR/gamification) are accurately reflected from the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses key terms like VR, AR, and gamification appropriately. While it doesn't explicitly define them, their usage within the context of rehabilitation is coherent. The term 'exoskeleton' is used consistently. The explanation of the gap between clinical and home-based rehabilitation is clear."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary adheres strictly to the prompt's constraint of being exactly 5 sentences long."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most critical aspects of the paper: the scope of the review, key findings regarding limb focus and popular devices, observed improvements, the identified gap in home-based rehabilitation, and future research directions. It omits some granular details about specific devices or assessment scales, which is appropriate for a concise summary."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the information presented in the research paper and does not introduce any unsupported claims or fabricated information."
  },
  "total_score": 58,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that effectively encapsulates the core findings and research question of the paper within the requested sentence limit. It is factually accurate, coherent, and directly addresses the prompt, providing a strong overview of the research."
