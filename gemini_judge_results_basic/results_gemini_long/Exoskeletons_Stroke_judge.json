{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the core research question of the paper: the effectiveness of combined technologies (exoskeletons with VR, AR, gamification) for stroke rehabilitation and the identification of trends and gaps."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings, including the focus on upper limb rehabilitation, the gap in lower limb research, and the need for home-based and personalized interventions. No numerical inaccuracies were found."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses technical terms like 'exoskeletons', 'virtual reality (VR)', 'augmented reality (AR)', and 'gamification' appropriately. While it doesn't explicitly define them, they are used in a context that is generally understandable for someone familiar with the field. The coherence is good, presenting a logical flow of findings."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is significantly longer, containing 6 substantial paragraphs and far exceeding the sentence limit."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the major relevant aspects of the paper: the technologies studied, the benefits observed, the limitations and gaps (upper vs. lower limb, home-based), the need for personalized games, and the challenges of transition. It is highly relevant to the original paper."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the content of the paper and does not introduce any unsupported claims or fabricate information."
  },
  "total_score": 49,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary provides a thorough and accurate overview of the research paper's findings, including its strengths and limitations. However, it critically fails to adhere to the sentence limit specified in the prompt, making it unsuitable as a direct response to the request."
