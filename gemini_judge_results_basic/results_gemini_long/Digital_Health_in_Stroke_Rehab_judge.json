  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the core research question of the paper, which is to explore the use of DHTs for stroke rehabilitation in Canada, identify gaps, and inform future decisions."
  },

    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately states the number of studies (14), the period covered (2010-2022), the focus on UE function and chronic phase, and the main technologies used (VR, gaming, mobile/sensor-based). It also correctly identifies key findings like feasibility, effectiveness, and barriers."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'Digital Health Technologies (DHTs)', 'Virtual Reality (VR)', and 'Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)' appropriately. While it doesn't explicitly explain every acronym, the context makes them generally understandable. The flow and coherence are good."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 5,

  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the key aspects of the paper: the scope, methods (implied by the description of the review), findings (feasibility, effectiveness, technology types, focus areas), barriers, and future directions/recommendations. It is highly relevant to the original paper."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the original paper. There are no unsupported or fabricated statements."
  },
  "total_score": 54,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is excellent in terms of its content, capturing the essence of the research paper accurately and comprehensively. It effectively conveys the findings, limitations, and recommendations. However, it fails to adhere to the specific constraint of the original prompt regarding the sentence count, significantly exceeding the requested five sentences."
