  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the central research question about how competition levels affect dominance hierarchies in dairy cows and the core finding of hierarchy flattening."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings presented in the paper, including the flattening of the hierarchy with increased competition, the rise of 2-way dyads, and the influence of resource valuation."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively explains key terms like 'flattening of the dominance hierarchy' and '2-way dyads' within the context of the research, making the findings understandable."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. This summary is significantly longer than 5 sentences (it's 5 paragraphs long). Therefore, it failed to follow the sentence constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "While the summary is highly relevant to the paper's core findings, it fails to adhere to the length constraint. The depth of explanation provided, while accurate, makes it exceed the requested scope in terms of length."
  },

    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the provided research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 45,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is excellent in its clarity, factual accuracy, and explanation of key concepts, accurately capturing the essence of the research. However, it completely fails to adhere to the strict sentence limit requested in the prompt, rendering it a verbose rather than a concise summary."
