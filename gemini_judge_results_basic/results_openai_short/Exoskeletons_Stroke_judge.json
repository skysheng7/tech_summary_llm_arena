  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research question: the effectiveness and trends of combining exoskeleton/robotic devices with VR, AR, or gamification for poststroke rehabilitation."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All factual claims, including the date range (2010-2017), number of studies (30), number of participants (approx. 385), limb focus (upper vs. lower), setting (clinic vs. home), types of interfaces, and general findings (positive improvements), are accurate based on the provided paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses key terms like 'exoskeleton/robotic devices,' 'virtual reality (VR),' 'augmented reality (AR),' and 'gamification' appropriately. The coherence is excellent, with each sentence logically building upon the previous one, creating a clear and easy-to-understand narrative."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary consists of exactly 5 sentences, directly adhering to the prompt's requirement."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most critical aspects of the paper: the objective, methodology (search sources), key findings (limb focus, setting, interface types, overall results), and the main conclusions and future implications. It is highly relevant to the original article."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the content of the paper and does not introduce any unsupported claims or information not present in the original text."
  },
  "total_score": 60,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent. It precisely follows the sentence count constraint, accurately captures the core findings and conclusions of the research, and presents the information in a coherent and relevant manner. Its strength lies in its conciseness and ability to distill complex information into easily digestible points."
