    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, precisely adhering to the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most important aspects of the study: the objective, methodology (data, prediction window, models), key results (performance of best model vs. reference), and the main conclusion/implication. It is highly relevant to the paper's content."
  },
