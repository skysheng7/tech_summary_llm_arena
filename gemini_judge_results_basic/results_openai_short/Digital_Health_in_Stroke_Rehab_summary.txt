  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the core research question of the paper: how digital technologies are used in stroke rehabilitation in Canada, what gaps exist, and how the findings can inform practice and policy."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary states that 61 studies were reviewed. However, the original paper clearly indicates that only 14 studies were included in the scoping review (Figure 1 and Abstract). This is a major factual inaccuracy."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate terminology like 'telerehabilitation', 'virtual reality', and 'gaming' and explains them implicitly through context. The flow is coherent and easy to understand."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a summary in 5 sentences. All provided versions of the summary contain exactly 5 sentences. However, the factual inaccuracy of the number of studies reviewed drastically impacts the overall utility of the summary, making a perfect score unwarranted."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary touches upon key aspects like the types of technologies, their promise, and barriers. However, due to the incorrect number of studies, it misses the specific focus on Canada and the detailed breakdown of findings presented in the paper. The mention of '61 studies' is not only factually wrong but also misrepresents the scope of the paper."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not contain any fabricated information. The primary issue is a misrepresentation of the number of studies reviewed, which stems from an error rather than hallucination."
  },
  "total_score": 35,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is well-written and adheres to the sentence count requested in the prompt. However, it contains a critical factual inaccuracy regarding the number of studies reviewed, which significantly undermines its completeness and relevance to the original paper."
