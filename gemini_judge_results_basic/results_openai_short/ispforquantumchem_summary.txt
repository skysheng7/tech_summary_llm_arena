  "research_question": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not attempt to address a research question. Instead, it focuses on the format of the input provided."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately identifies that the provided input is a collection of references and not a cohesive document, making summarization difficult."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses clear language and the reasoning for its inability to summarize is coherent and easy to understand."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary explicitly states that it cannot fulfill the prompt's request for a 5-sentence summary due to the input's nature. Therefore, it completely failed to follow the prompt."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary is irrelevant to the prompt because it does not summarize the provided text; instead, it discusses why summarization is not possible."

    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not hallucinate, as it accurately describes the provided input as a collection of references."
  },
  "total_score": 20,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary accurately identifies the input as a collection of references and correctly explains why a 5-sentence summary is not feasible. However, it completely fails to follow the prompt's core instruction to provide a summary, rendering it irrelevant to the task."
