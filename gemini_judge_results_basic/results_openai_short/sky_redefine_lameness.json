    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately identifies the core research question of the paper: to develop and validate a novel method for lameness assessment in dairy cows using crowd-sourced pairwise comparisons to construct a lameness hierarchy, and to assess its reliability and efficiency compared to traditional methods."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reports the key findings and numerical data presented in the paper, including ICC values for expert and crowd worker reliability, the reduction in comparisons, and the number of crowd workers needed. All figures and statements align with the source material."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively uses and implicitly explains key terms like 'lameness hierarchy,' 'pairwise comparison,' 'EloSteepness,' and 'ICC' within the context of the study. The flow is logical and the language is coherent, making the complex methodology understandable."
