  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the overarching research goal of the paper, which is to introduce and validate a novel method for lameness assessment in dairy cows using crowd-sourced data to construct a lameness hierarchy. It highlights the key contributions and comparisons made in the study."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the core findings and methods described in the paper, including the use of pairwise comparisons, Elo-rating, crowd-sourcing (MTurk), the comparison with traditional gait scoring, and the successful construction of a lameness hierarchy."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate technical terms like 'pairwise lameness assessment,' 'Elo-rating,' and 'crowd-sourced data' without requiring extensive explanation for someone familiar with the domain. The coherence is good, with a logical flow from the problem to the solution and findings."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is exactly 5 sentences long."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most critical aspects of the paper: the problem (lameness detection), the proposed solution (pairwise assessment, hierarchy construction), the methodology (crowd-sourcing, Elo-rating), the key findings (high reliability, efficiency), and the implications (enabling large datasets). It focuses on the most relevant information."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 58,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that accurately captures the essence of the research paper within the requested sentence limit. It effectively communicates the novel approach, methodology, and key findings, demonstrating strong factual accuracy and coherence."
