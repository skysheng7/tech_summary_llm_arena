  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the core research question: how generative AI (specifically DALL-E 3) depicts livestock farming, and how prompt revision influences this depiction by potentially obscuring the reality of intensive farming practices."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings of the paper, including the default pastoral bias of DALL-E 3, the effect of disabling prompt revision, the origin of the bias in the revision process, and the potential consequences for public perception and dialogue."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses clear and coherent language, and introduces essential terms like 'prompt refinement' and 'intensive agricultural methods' appropriately within the context of the findings. The flow of information is logical and easy to understand."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary consists of exactly 5 sentences, adhering perfectly to the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most crucial aspects of the paper: the problem identified (idealized imagery), the cause (prompt revision), the evidence (DALL-E 3 behavior), the implications (perpetuating inaccuracies), and proposed solutions (transparency, authentic imagery). All points are highly relevant to the research."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the original paper. There are no unsupported or fabricated statements."
  },
  "total_score": 60,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent. It accurately captures the essence of the research, adheres strictly to the prompt's length constraint, and presents the information in a clear and coherent manner. It effectively conveys the problem, findings, implications, and proposed solutions of the study."
