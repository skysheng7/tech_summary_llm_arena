{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately identifies the core research question, which is to develop a novel method for lameness assessment in dairy cows using crowd-sourced data to construct a lameness hierarchy."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are factually supported by the paper. For instance, the strong agreement among evaluators, the feasibility for untrained workers, the use of a 5-milestone subsampling algorithm, and the potential for broader applications are all accurately represented."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses key terms like 'lameness hierarchy', 'pairwise cow comparison', 'crowd workers', and 'subsampling algorithm' effectively and coherently. While 'subsampling algorithm' is a technical term, its context within the summary makes its function understandable. The term 'Elo-rating' is not explicitly explained but is implied through the concept of ranking."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, adhering perfectly to the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the most critical aspects of the paper: the novel method, its validation, the efficiency gains, its superiority to traditional methods, and its future potential. It is highly relevant to the paper's content."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "There are no unsupported claims or fabricated information in the summary. All points made are directly derived from the provided research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that accurately captures the essence of the research paper. It follows the sentence constraint precisely and coherently explains the study's novel approach, its validation, and its potential impact, making it highly relevant and factually accurate."
