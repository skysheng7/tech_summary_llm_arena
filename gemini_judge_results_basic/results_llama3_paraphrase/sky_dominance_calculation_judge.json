  "research_question": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core research question about how competition affects dominance hierarchies in dairy cows, but doesn't explicitly state the hypothesis or methodology in a way that fully addresses the 'research question' aspect of the rubric. It focuses more on the findings."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 7,
    "reasoning": "The summary correctly identifies that increased competition flattens dominance hierarchies and can lead to more equitable resource sharing. However, it introduces the idea that this can trigger 'elevated levels of aggression and stress,' which is not a primary finding or conclusion highlighted in the paper's abstract or discussion regarding the immediate impact of competition on hierarchy structure itself, although it touches on welfare concerns in the discussion section."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'dominance structures,' 'competitive pressures,' and 'social rankings' which are relevant. However, it doesn't explicitly explain key terms like 'dominance hierarchy steepness' or '2-way dyads' which are central to the paper's findings."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is presented as 4 sentences, not the requested 5 sentences."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 7,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main finding about flattened hierarchies due to competition and the resulting more equitable resource access. It misses specific details like the methodology (Elo ratings, feeder occupancy) and quantitative results that were central to the paper. The mention of aggression and stress is relevant to a broader discussion but less directly a core finding of the hierarchy flattening itself."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The claim that increased competition 'may also trigger elevated levels of aggression and stress' is not directly supported as a primary outcome of this study. While the paper discusses welfare concerns and increased agonistic interactions, it doesn't directly conclude that the *flattened hierarchy* itself causes these negative outcomes, but rather that high competition *leads* to both flattened hierarchies and more interactions. This is a subtle but important distinction."
  },
  "total_score": 30,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary accurately captures the main overarching finding that increased competition flattens dominance hierarchies, leading to more equitable resource sharing. However, it falls short on prompt adherence (sentence count) and lacks specific details about the methodology and quantitative results presented in the paper. The mention of stress and aggression as a direct consequence of the hierarchy flattening is not fully supported by the study's primary conclusions."
