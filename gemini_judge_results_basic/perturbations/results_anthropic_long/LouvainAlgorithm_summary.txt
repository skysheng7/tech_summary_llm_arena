  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the main research question, which is to develop a fast and effective algorithm for community detection in large networks, optimizing modularity."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the core concepts, methodology (two-phase iterative process, modularity optimization, aggregation), and findings (speed, accuracy, application to Belgian mobile phone network) of the paper. It avoids introducing new facts and sticks to the information presented."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Key terms like 'modularity', 'heuristic algorithm', 'community structure', and 'hierarchical nature' are explained or used in a context that makes their meaning clear. The explanation of the two-phase process is coherent. 'Meta-nodes' is a good explanation of the aggregation step. The explanation of linear complexity is also good."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is significantly longer, acting as an expanded explanation rather than a concise summary. It includes multiple paragraphs and far exceeds the requested sentence count."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "While the summary is relevant and covers the main points, it is not 'complete' in the context of the prompt's sentence limit. It provides an excessive amount of detail and explanation, going beyond what a 5-sentence summary would entail. The phrase 'without introducing new facts' seems to have been interpreted as 'without being concise'."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not introduce any unsupported claims or facts not present in the original paper. It faithfully restates and elaborates on the information provided."
  },
  "total_score": 44,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary provides a thorough and accurate explanation of the paper's algorithm, its advantages, and its application. However, it completely failed to adhere to the prompt's request for a 5-sentence summary, instead offering a lengthy, detailed exposition."
