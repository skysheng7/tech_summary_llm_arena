  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research question: developing a new, reliable, and efficient method for lameness assessment in dairy cows using crowd-sourced pairwise comparisons to construct a hierarchy, contrasting it with traditional gait scoring."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reports the key findings, including the low ICC for traditional gait scoring (0.44-0.62) and the high ICC for the proposed pairwise method among experts (0.81) and between experts and crowd workers (0.85). It correctly mentions the subsampling algorithm and the findings about 8 workers and 37% comparisons. It missed a specific detail about the average gait score range, but this is a minor omission for a concise summary."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary explains key terms like 'pairwise comparisons,' 'lameness hierarchy,' and 'Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)' within context. It also clearly differentiates between 'traditional gait scoring' and the 'novel pairwise assessment method.' The flow is logical and easy to follow."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary provided is significantly longer than the requested 5 sentences. It is structured as a detailed, multi-paragraph explanation rather than a concise, 5-sentence summary. The prompt specifically asked for a 5-sentence summary, and this response is many times that length."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the most important aspects of the paper: the problem, the proposed solution (pairwise comparison hierarchy), its advantages over traditional methods (reliability, crowd-sourcing feasibility), and efficiency findings (subsampling). It focuses on the core contributions and findings."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the content of the paper and does not introduce any unsupported claims or fabricated information."
  },
  "total_score": 47,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is exceptionally well-written and accurately captures the essence and key findings of the research paper, providing clear explanations for technical terms. However, it completely failed to adhere to the prompt's constraint of being exactly 5 sentences long, presenting a much more extensive explanation instead."
