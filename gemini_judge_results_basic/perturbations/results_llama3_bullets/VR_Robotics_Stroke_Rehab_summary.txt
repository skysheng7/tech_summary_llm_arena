  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the core research question, which is about the effectiveness and feasibility of virtual reality-based robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation in stroke patients."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the findings of the study, including the significant improvements in balance, gait, and activities of daily living, and the overall positive impact of the VR-based robotic training."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate terminology like 'virtual reality-based robotic training' and 'lower extremity rehabilitation'. The coherence is good, presenting the information in a logical flow from introduction to conclusion. Some terms like 'subacute stroke' could have been slightly elaborated for a broader audience, but it's acceptable within a research summary context."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is presented as bullet points, which is not a direct adherence to the sentence format requested. If each bullet point is considered a sentence, it meets the count, but the formatting deviates from the prompt."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the key aspects of the study: the intervention, the target population, the primary outcomes, the results, and the overall conclusion, making it highly relevant and complete within the scope of a brief summary."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "There are no unsupported claims or hallucinations in the summary; all points are directly derived from the content of the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 52,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is factually accurate and covers the main points of the research paper effectively, highlighting the benefits of VR-based robotic training. However, it fails to strictly adhere to the requested 5-sentence format by presenting the information in bullet points, which impacts its adherence to the prompt."
