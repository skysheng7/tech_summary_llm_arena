  "research_question": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "No article was provided, so no research question could be addressed."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately states that no article was provided for summarization."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is coherent and uses simple, understandable language. No specialized terminology was used as no article was processed."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary of an article. Since no article was provided, this could not be fulfilled. The response is more of a placeholder than a summary."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "No article was provided, so no information from the article could be included in the summary. The summary is therefore completely irrelevant to the content of a non-existent article."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not hallucinate any information as it correctly identifies that no article was provided."
  },
  "total_score": 20,
  "overall_assessment": "The provided summary is a placeholder that correctly identifies the absence of the source article. It cannot be meaningfully evaluated for research question, factual accuracy, completeness, relevance, or hallucination as it does not summarize any content. Its only function is to state the lack of input."
