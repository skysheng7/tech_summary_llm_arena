  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research question of the paper, which is to review and synthesize the literature on exoskeleton-based rehabilitation for stroke patients combined with VR, AR, and gamification, and to assess their effectiveness."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings and discussions within the paper, including the positive outcomes reported, the limitations of the studies, and the overall conclusion about the potential of these technologies."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate terminology like 'exoskeletons', 'virtual reality (VR)', 'augmented reality (AR)', and 'gamification'. While these terms are central to the paper, the summary does not explicitly explain them. However, in the context of a summary for a technical paper, this is acceptable as the target audience is likely familiar with these terms. The coherence is good."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt specifically asked for a summary in 5 sentences. The provided summary is in bullet points, not sentences, and contains 5 bullet points. This is a direct deviation from the requested format."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the main aspects of the paper: the scope of the review, the objectives, the general findings (positive outcomes), the limitations, and the conclusion with recommendations for future research. All points are highly relevant to the article's content."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "There are no unsupported claims or information that is not present in the original paper. The summary accurately represents the content of the review."
  },
  "total_score": 45,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary accurately captures the key findings, limitations, and conclusions of the research paper, making it factually sound and relevant. However, it fails to adhere to the prompt's requirement of providing the summary in 5 sentences, instead opting for bullet points."
