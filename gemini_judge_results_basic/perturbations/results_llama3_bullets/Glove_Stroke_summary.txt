  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the core research question of the paper: evaluating the therapeutic effects of wearable robotic gloves on improving hand function in stroke patients."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary is factually accurate regarding the findings and conclusions of the paper. It correctly states that robotic gloves show benefits, but there are limitations in current research regarding long-term effects, sample size, and methodological quality. The only minor point is that the summary mentions reducing spasticity as a benefit, whereas the paper notes that the studies included mostly patients with low spasticity and the effects on higher spasticity levels are unknown."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate terminology and explains concepts coherently without requiring extensive background knowledge. Terms like 'robotic gloves,' 'hand function,' 'stroke patients,' and 'spasticity' are used in context and are easily understood."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt specifically requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary has 6 bullet points, with the last one acting as a concluding sentence. This exceeds the requested sentence limit."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most important aspects of the paper, including the purpose of the review, the general findings, the limitations of current research, and the future directions. It is highly relevant to the original paper."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "There are no unsupported claims or fabricated information in the summary. All points are derived directly from the content of the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 49,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary effectively captures the essence of the research, detailing the potential benefits of robotic gloves for stroke patients and highlighting the significant limitations of current studies. Its primary weakness is exceeding the requested sentence count for the summary."
