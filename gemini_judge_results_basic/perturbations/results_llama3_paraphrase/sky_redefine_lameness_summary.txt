  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research question, which is about developing and evaluating a novel method for lameness assessment in dairy cows using crowd-sourced data and pairwise comparisons, aiming for a more granular and efficient labeling process."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings of the paper, including the proposed method, the comparison with traditional methods, the reliability metrics (ICC), the use of crowd workers, and the efficiency gains in terms of comparisons and worker numbers."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate terminology (e.g., lameness hierarchy, pairwise lameness assessment, EloSteepness, ICC) and explains them implicitly through context. The flow is logical and easy to understand for someone familiar with the domain. It avoids overly technical jargon where possible."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a summary in 5 sentences. The provided summary (Option 1) contains exactly 5 sentences, fulfilling the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most critical aspects of the paper: the problem (lameness detection), the proposed solution (pairwise comparison lameness hierarchy), its advantages (efficiency, granularity, crowd-sourcing feasibility), and its comparison to traditional methods. It prioritizes the most relevant information."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "There are no unsupported claims or information that cannot be found within the provided research paper. All points mentioned in the summary are directly supported by the text."
  },
  "total_score": 58,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent, accurately capturing the essence of the research paper within the requested sentence limit. It effectively highlights the novelty of the pairwise assessment approach, its feasibility with crowd workers, and its advantages over traditional methods."
