  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research question: how competition affects dominance hierarchies, specifically in dairy cows. It touches upon the observed flattening of hierarchies and the implications for resource access and aggression."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary is largely factually accurate, reflecting the findings of a flattened hierarchy with increased competition and the potential for increased aggression. However, it does not include specific numerical findings from the paper (e.g., the rate at which hierarchy steepness fell or the increase in 2-way dyads) which would have strengthened its accuracy."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses understandable language. Terms like 'dominance structures,' 'competitive pressures,' and 'social rankings' are used coherently. 'Flattened dominance hierarchy' is a key concept that is well-represented."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt explicitly requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary has only 4 sentences. This is a clear deviation from the prompt's constraints."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 7,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the main findings regarding the flattening of dominance hierarchies due to competition and the potential for increased aggression. However, it omits details about the methodology (e.g., using feeder occupancy as a measure of competition, Elo ratings) and specific quantitative results presented in the paper."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not contain any hallucinatory claims. All statements made are consistent with the overall themes and findings of the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 32,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary provides a coherent and mostly accurate overview of the paper's main findings regarding the impact of competition on dominance hierarchies. However, it falls short of the requested sentence count and lacks specific details from the research, such as quantitative data and methodological nuances."
