  "research_question": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not address the research question of the paper itself. Instead, it focuses on the nature of the input provided to it."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately describes the input it received as a collection of references, citations, and links, rather than a unified document. It correctly infers that this format is typical of academic work."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The terminology used (citations, hyperlinks, references, scholarly research, academic publication) is clear and accurately describes the input. The explanation of why a summary is not feasible is coherent."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary of the *article*. The summary states that a 5-sentence summary is not feasible and proceeds to explain why. It does not provide the requested summary."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary is not relevant to the content of the research paper. It focuses on the format of the input rather than the research questions, methods, or findings of the paper."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not hallucinate information about the research paper. It accurately describes the input it received and its limitations."
  },
  "total_score": 20,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary correctly identifies that the provided input is not a cohesive article suitable for summarization. However, it completely fails to address the original prompt by not summarizing the research paper, and instead explains its inability to do so. Therefore, it fails on prompt following and completeness/relevance."
