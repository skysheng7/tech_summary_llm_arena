  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question: how DALL-E 3's prompt revision process impacts the depiction of intensive livestock farming, leading to the erasure of its realities and the introduction of biases."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings of the paper, including the default pastoral bias of DALL-E 3, the effect of prompt revision, the results when prompt revision was disabled, and the comparison with real-world statistics."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses key terms like 'prompt revision,' 'pastoral bias,' and 'coded gaze' coherently. While 'coded gaze' is not explicitly defined, its context within the summary makes its general meaning understandable."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a summary of 5 sentences, but the provided summary consists of 6 bullet points, each representing a sentence. This fails to adhere to the sentence limit."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the essential aspects of the research, including the problem, the methodology (disabling prompt revision), the key findings (differences in depictions), the comparison with real-world data, and the broader implications of the bias."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "There are no unsupported claims or fabricated information in the summary; all points are directly derived from the provided paper."
  },
  "total_score": 49,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary accurately and comprehensively captures the essence of the research paper, highlighting the significant bias in AI image generation regarding livestock farming. However, it fails to adhere to the requested sentence limit, presenting information in bullet points that exceed the stipulated length."
