  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question: the effectiveness and feasibility of VR-based robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation in stroke patients with hemiplegia."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All the numerical data and key findings presented in the summary (e.g., participant numbers, mean differences, p-values, and effect sizes) are accurately reflected from the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 7,
    "reasoning": "While the summary uses technical terms like 'hemiplegia,' 'FMA-LE,' and 'BBS,' it doesn't explain them. However, the coherence and flow of the summary are good, making it understandable to someone with some background knowledge in the field. A brief explanation of key terms would improve this score."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a summary in 5 sentences. The provided summary is presented as a bulleted list and far exceeds 5 sentences, thus failing to follow the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is comprehensive in covering the main aspects of the study, including methods, results, and conclusions. However, it presents information in a bulleted format, which deviates from a standard narrative summary. If it were in sentence form, it would be higher."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the information presented in the research paper without introducing any unsupported claims or fabricating data."
  },
  "total_score": 42,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is factually accurate and comprehensive, covering the key findings, methods, and conclusions of the study. However, it completely disregards the prompt's instruction to provide a 5-sentence summary, opting for a detailed bulleted list instead, which significantly impacts its adherence to the prompt."
