  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question: developing a new, reliable, and efficient method for lameness assessment in dairy cows using crowd-sourced data and pairwise comparisons."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical values and findings reported in the summary (e.g., ICC scores, percentage of comparisons) accurately reflect the information presented in the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses technical terms like 'lameness hierarchy,' 'pairwise comparisons,' and 'ICC' appropriately. While 'ICC' is not explicitly defined, its context within reliability measurements is clear. The overall coherence is high."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, directly adhering to the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the most crucial aspects of the paper: the novel method, its comparison to traditional methods, the reliability findings (expert and crowd), the efficiency gains (workers and comparisons), and the overall implications for automated detection systems. All points are highly relevant."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "There are no unsupported claims or information not present in the original paper. The summary accurately reflects the study's findings and methodology."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that precisely follows the prompt's constraints and accurately captures the essence of the research paper. It effectively highlights the novel methodology, its superior reliability compared to traditional methods, and its practical efficiency through crowd-sourcing."
