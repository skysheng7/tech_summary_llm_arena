  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research questions regarding the use of DHTs in Canada, identifying gaps, and informing future decisions. It reflects the 'how,' 'what gaps,' and 'how to inform' aspects of the original research questions."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the numerical data presented in the paper, such as the percentage of studies focusing on upper extremity function (85.71%), chronic phase (64.3%), and home settings (50%). It also correctly lists the types of technologies and the identified facilitators and barriers."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate terminology for the field (DHTs, VR, telerehabilitation, RCTs) and presents it coherently. While some terms like 'RCTs' are not explicitly defined within the summary itself, their meaning is generally inferable from the context of research. The flow is logical and easy to follow."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a summary in 5 sentences. The provided summary (all options) far exceeds this limit, with Option 1 having 7 sentences, Option 2 having 7 sentences, and Option 3 being incomplete but likely to exceed 5 sentences if finished. This is a significant deviation from the prompt."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the key aspects of the paper: the methodology (scoping review, number of studies), the main findings (focus on UE, chronic phase, home settings), the types of technologies, facilitators and barriers, identified gaps (LE, cognition, acute/subacute phases), and future directions/recommendations. All information is highly relevant to the paper's scope."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not contain any unsupported claims or information not present in the original paper. All points discussed are directly derived from the provided text."
  },
  "total_score": 48,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is excellent in its content, providing a thorough and accurate representation of the research paper's findings, limitations, and future directions. It effectively captures the essence of the study and its implications. However, it completely fails to adhere to the sentence limit specified in the prompt, which significantly impacts its overall utility as a response to that specific request."
