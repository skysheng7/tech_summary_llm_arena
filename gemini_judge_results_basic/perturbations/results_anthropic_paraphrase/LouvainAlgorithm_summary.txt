  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the core research question: developing a fast and efficient algorithm for community detection in large networks, specifically focusing on modularity optimization and hierarchical structure."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All factual claims in the summary, including the method's two-phase iterative process, computational speed (118 million nodes in 152 minutes), comparison to previous methods (5 million nodes limit), and application to the Belgian mobile phone network, are accurately reflected from the paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary correctly uses key terms like 'modularity optimization', 'heuristic algorithm', 'community hierarchies', and 'meta-networks'. While it doesn't explicitly define these terms, their context within the summary makes their meaning generally understandable to someone familiar with the field. The coherence is good."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a summary in 5 sentences. The provided summary has 5 sentences. However, the phrasing 'Here's a paraphrased summary...using different wording and sentence structure, while retaining all original information' suggests it's not a direct answer to the prompt but a rephrased output. Despite having the correct sentence count, this framing makes it a partial follow-through."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most crucial aspects of the paper: the proposed algorithm, its methodology, its performance advantages (speed and accuracy), and a key application example. It's highly relevant and comprehensive for a short summary."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary sticks strictly to the information presented in the provided text and does not introduce any unsupported claims or fabricated details."
  },
  "total_score": 48,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is highly accurate and comprehensive, effectively capturing the essence of the research paper's contribution. Its primary weakness is a slight ambiguity in its presentation, as it frames itself as a rephrased output rather than a direct response to the prompt, even though it adheres to the sentence count. Nevertheless, it provides a strong overview of the algorithm's novelty and performance."
