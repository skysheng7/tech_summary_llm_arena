  "research_question": {
    "score": 7,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core of the research, which is exploring digital health technologies for stroke rehabilitation in Canada, but it doesn't explicitly state the research questions as presented in the paper."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 3,
    "reasoning": "The summary states that the review encompasses findings from 'sixty-one individual studies,' which is factually incorrect. The original paper clearly states that only 14 studies were included in the review (p. 3, section 2.4). This is a significant factual error."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary explains terms like telerehabilitation and virtual reality, and the language is generally coherent. However, the redundancy and verbosity detract from its overall coherence."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The original prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is significantly longer, exceeding the sentence limit by a wide margin and explicitly stating it is 'longer... than five sentences'."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary touches on the main themes (digital tech, stroke rehab, benefits, challenges) but lacks specificity due to the factual error regarding the number of studies. It is also overly verbose for a concise summary. It misses the Canada-specific focus which was central to the original paper."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not contain any unsupported claims or information not present in the original paper, beyond the significant factual error about the number of studies."
  },
  "total_score": 33,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary fails significantly in prompt following due to its excessive length and factual inaccuracy regarding the number of studies included. While it touches on the general themes of the paper, its verbosity and lack of precision make it a poor summary."
