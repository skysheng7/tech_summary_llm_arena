{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research question of the paper, which is to review and categorize studies on exoskeletons combined with VR, AR, or gamification for stroke rehabilitation, and assess their effectiveness."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the data presented in the paper, including the number of studies, participant numbers, time frame, databases searched, and the breakdown of study characteristics (limb type, setting, interaction type). It also correctly notes the absence of AR-based stroke-exoskeleton studies in their sample."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate technical terms like 'systematic review,' 'exoskeleton,' 'virtual reality (VR),' 'augmented reality (AR),' 'gamification,' 'poststroke rehabilitation,' 'randomized trials,' and 'exploratory designs' coherently. It also explains the practical implications of the findings without oversimplifying."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary has 5 sentences. However, the prompt also included 'Here is the reordered summary:' which is not an instruction for the LLM but rather an artifact from how the summary was presented to the LLM. Therefore, the prompt following is only partial as it doesn't reflect the original prompt's intent."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is highly complete and relevant, covering the main aspects of the paper: the objective, methodology, key findings (including specific details like limb type, setting, and interaction types), and the main conclusions and future directions. It distills the essence of the research effectively."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "There are no apparent hallucinations or unsupported claims in the summary. All information presented appears to be derived directly from the provided research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 49,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is of high quality, accurately capturing the paper's research question, methodology, key findings, and conclusions within the requested sentence count. It demonstrates strong factual accuracy and relevance, making it a comprehensive and well-written synopsis of the article."
