  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research question of how DALL-E 3's prompt revision impacts the depiction of intensive livestock farming, focusing on the bias towards pastoral imagery and the erasure of indoor realities."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings of the study, including the default pastoral bias, the effect of disabling prompt revision, the partial emergence of regional differences, and the authors' main arguments and recommendations."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses clear language and coherently explains the main concepts like 'prompt revision,' 'pastoral imagery,' and 'intensive livestock farming.' The term 'romanticize' is well-used in context. It could be slightly improved by explicitly mentioning the term 'coded gaze' if it were a central theme, but it's not strictly necessary for a 5-sentence summary."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary consists of exactly 5 sentences, directly adhering to the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most crucial aspects of the paper: the observed bias, the mechanism causing it (prompt revision), the experiment to counteract it, the regional findings, and the authors' conclusions and recommendations. It is highly relevant to the paper's core message."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the research paper. No unsupported or fabricated information is present."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that perfectly follows the prompt's length constraint while accurately and comprehensively conveying the paper's key findings and arguments. Its strength lies in its conciseness and clarity in explaining the core issue of AI bias in depicting livestock farming."
