    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "It captures the central question: whether DALL-E 3’s prompt revision causes biased/romanticized depictions of livestock farming and whether disabling it yields more realistic images. However, it does not explicitly mention all stated research sub-questions (default vs. typical vs. reality prompts; geographic variation across regions; comparison to real-world housing statistics)."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the paper’s main findings: pastoral defaults under prompt revision; persistence even under realism requests; and a shift toward indoor depictions when prompt revision is inhibited. It does not cite any specific numbers (e.g., 100% pastoral for basic dairy with revision; ~96% indoor for pigs without revision), so there are no numerical errors to penalize, but it also omits key quantitative results."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Clear, coherent, and accessible. Key concept (“automatic prompt revision”) is explained sufficiently in context. It avoids excessive jargon and maintains a logical flow from question → method mechanism → findings → implications → recommendations."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "Exactly 5 sentences, matching the prompt requirement."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "It covers the paper’s core takeaway (prompt revision drives romanticized depictions; disabling it increases realism; policy transparency recommendation). It misses important supporting components: the scale of the experiment (4,800 images; 48 prompts; 100 images/prompt), the indoor/outdoor categorization approach, and the regional-analysis result that geographic variation emerges without revision and partially mirrors real-world statistics."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "No unsupported claims. All major statements (pastoral bias, mechanism via prompt revision, more realistic outputs when revision is inhibited, misinformation risk, and transparency recommendations) are directly consistent with the paper."
  },
  "total_score": 54,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is accurate, coherent, and tightly aligned with the paper’s main conclusion that prompt revision introduces a pastoral/romanticizing bias in DALL-E 3’s livestock-farming imagery. Its main weakness is incompleteness: it omits key experimental details, quantitative results, and the regional/statistics comparison that strengthens the paper’s empirical contribution."
