  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Clearly states the study aim: assessing effectiveness of VR-based robotic lower-limb training in stroke patients with hemiplegia. It does not explicitly mention the paper’s additional focus on safety/feasibility and cognitive function as part of the stated purpose, but these are implied later."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Core design and direction of findings are accurate (VR-robot + conventional rehab vs conventional alone; better motor outcomes; no between-group cognitive difference). It omits key quantitative details (e.g., FMA-LE change 6.5 vs 3.3, p<0.001; MoCA p=0.873; no adverse events) but does not introduce incorrect numbers."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Coherent, readable, and uses limited technical jargon. Terms like hemiplegia and activities of daily living are standard and understandable in context; no confusing unexplained metrics are introduced."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "Exactly 5 sentences, matching the prompt requirement."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Covers the main takeaways: intervention, comparator, key outcomes (motor, balance, walking, ADL, QoL), and lack of cognitive between-group effect, plus call for larger studies. Missing important context: sample size (42 enrolled/40 completed), duration (4 weeks, 5x/week), pilot open-label RCT/assessor-blinded nature, and explicit safety finding (no adverse events)."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims are supported by the paper (improvements in motor/balance/walking/ADL/QoL, no significant between-group cognitive effect, feasibility/promise, need for larger studies). No fabricated methods, outcomes, or conclusions."
  },
  "total_score": 54,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is concise, coherent, and accurately captures the study’s main purpose and the direction of the primary and secondary results, while correctly noting the null between-group cognitive finding. Its main weakness is lack of key methodological and quantitative specifics (sample size, duration/intensity, effect sizes/p-values, and explicit safety result), which reduces informativeness despite being factually sound."
