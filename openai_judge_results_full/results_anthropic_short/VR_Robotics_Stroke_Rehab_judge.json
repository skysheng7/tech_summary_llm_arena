    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Clearly states the study is evaluating effectiveness (and implicitly feasibility/safety) of VR-based robotic lower-limb rehabilitation in stroke patients with hemiplegia, aligning with the paper’s aims (motor function, plus cognition/ADL/QoL and safety). It could be slightly clearer that safety/feasibility are explicit aims, not just inferred from results."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 7,
    "reasoning": "Core design and main findings are largely correct (pilot RCT, 4-week intervention, key outcomes improved; MoCA not different; no adverse events). However, it says the trial included 42 patients and then describes groups as n=20 vs n=20; in the paper 42 were randomized (21/21) and 40 completed (20/20). Also the summary reports MD 6.5 vs 3.3 without noting p<0.001, and does not distinguish baseline-to-week-4 change vs between-group difference, which could be interpreted ambiguously."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Well-written and coherent with minimal jargon. Terms like 'hemiplegia,' 'activities of daily living,' and 'mean difference' are understandable to a general clinical audience; however, the summary does not explain acronyms/metrics (e.g., FMA-LE, BBS, FAC, MoCA) since it avoids them, which is acceptable, but 'mean difference 6.5 vs 3.3' could use a brief clarification that it is pre–post change."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "Provides exactly 5 sentences, matching the prompt requirement for a 5-sentence summary."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Covers the essential elements: study type, setting/population, intervention dose/duration, main outcomes (motor, balance, walking, ADL, QoL), null finding for cognition, safety, and need for larger studies. Minor omission: feasibility aspects beyond safety (acceptability/delivery) and assessor-blinding/open-label nature are not mentioned, but these are secondary to take-home results."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Most statements are supported by the paper. The main concern is the implied enrollment/completion counts (mixing 42 enrolled with n=20 per arm without clarifying dropouts), which is a mild factual distortion rather than a major fabrication. Claims about 'demonstrating safety and feasibility' are broadly supported (no adverse events; feasible/acceptable) though feasibility metrics were not deeply quantified."
  },
  "total_score": 51,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is clear, well-structured, and captures the main intervention, outcomes, and conclusion in exactly five sentences. Its main weakness is minor numerical/flow inconsistency (42 randomized vs 40 completed) and some ambiguity about what the reported mean differences represent, but it otherwise aligns closely with the paper and avoids major unsupported claims."
