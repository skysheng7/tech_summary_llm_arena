  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Accurately states the central question: whether untrained crowd workers can perform reliable comparison-based lameness assessments from paired cow-walking videos, and how many workers are needed to match expert ratings. It could be slightly clearer that the core is validity vs experienced assessors and scalability/cost-effectiveness."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "Key design and numerical results match the paper: 11 HIT with 10 pairs each, 50 workers/HIT, 5 experienced assessors; crowd-worker ICC range 0.46–0.77; expert ICC 0.87; crowd-average vs expert-average ICC 0.89–0.91; and the plateau after ~10 workers with ICC > 0.80."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Clear and coherent, with minimal jargon. However, ICC is used without being expanded (intraclass correlation coefficient) or briefly explained as an agreement/reliability metric, which would improve accessibility for non-technical readers."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary itself is 5 sentences, but it also includes an extra header line (\"Here is a 5-sentence summary of the article:\") which makes the total output not strictly a 5-sentence response."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "Covers the major contributions and takeaways: the comparative crowdsourcing method, task setup, expert comparison, agreement results, and the practical finding that ~10 workers suffice, plus the implication for scalable data collection and computer vision training."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "No unsupported claims detected; all statements align with the abstract/results/conclusions of the paper."
  },
  "total_score": 52,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is highly accurate and captures the study’s research aim, methods, key reliability findings, and practical implications. Its main weakness is minor prompt noncompliance due to the added preface line and a lack of brief explanation for ICC, which slightly reduces accessibility."
