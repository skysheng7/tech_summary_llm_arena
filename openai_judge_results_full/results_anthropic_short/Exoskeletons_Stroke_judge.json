  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Correctly states that the paper reviews exoskeleton-based stroke rehabilitation combined with VR/AR/gamification and implicitly targets effectiveness and practice/technology trends. It could more explicitly mention the paper’s stated aims (effectiveness, trends/configurations, and future challenges) rather than only “examines the use.”"
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Key numbers and facts match the paper: 30 studies; years 2010-2017; ~385 participants; 28/30 upper limb; interaction split 15 VR and 15 games; setting split clinic 25, home 4, both 1; and noting no AR-based systems in the included sample. Minor imprecision: the paper suggests motivation/engagement benefits but does not quantitatively establish superiority over traditional rehab across all included studies."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Clear and coherent, with minimal jargon. However, terms like “gamification” and “interfacing techniques” are not explained, and the distinction between VR-based games vs. nongamified VR is not clarified (though it remains understandable in a short summary)."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "Provides exactly 5 sentences (listed as 1–5), matching the prompt requirement."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Covers major takeaways: scope and methods (systematic review, time window, N studies/participants), key distributions (upper vs lower limb; VR vs games; clinic vs home), overall positive motor outcomes, the home-transition gap, and future needs (customizable games; AR absence). It slightly underplays the paper’s methodological framing (PRISMA, qualitative synthesis due to heterogeneity) and the explicit objective of improving activity/participation, but overall captures the core contributions."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Most statements are supported by the paper. The only potentially unsupported/overgeneralized claim is that patients showed increased motivation/engagement “compared to traditional rehabilitation methods” as a broad conclusion; the paper motivates this with background and some cited findings but does not uniformly demonstrate comparative superiority across the full included set."
  },
  "total_score": 53,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is largely accurate and highly aligned with the paper’s main findings, correctly reporting key counts (studies, participants, upper vs lower limb focus, VR vs games, and clinic vs home settings) and the notable lack of AR systems. Its main weakness is a slight overgeneralization about motivation/engagement being better than traditional rehab across studies, and it could more explicitly reflect the paper’s stated aims and qualitative/heterogeneous nature of the evidence."
