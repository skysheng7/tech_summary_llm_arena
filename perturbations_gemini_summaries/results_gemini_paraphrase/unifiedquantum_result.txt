New "no-go" theorems are presented in this research, which consolidate established concepts like the no-cloning and no-deleting theorems within quantum mechanics. A novel "no-encoding" theorem is put forth, asserting that a universal quantum transformation cannot achieve the linear superposition of an unknown pure state and a predetermined state within a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Furthermore, the paper offers unified methodologies for both ideal and non-ideal quantum operations, including cloning and deleting, with their efficacy contingent on the linear independence of the initial states. The authors also introduce novel methods for superposing unknown pure states from finite sets and for scenarios where multiple instances of input states are at hand. The overarching objective of this paper is to enhance the comprehension of quantum transformations and their inherent constraints, stemming from the fundamental principle of superposition.

**Paraphrase 2:**

In this study, novel "no-go" theorems are introduced that serve to integrate existing quantum mechanical principles such as the no-cloning and no-deleting theorems. A newly proposed "no-encoding" theorem demonstrates that, within a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, a universal quantum transformation is incapable of linearly combining an unknown pure state with a specific, fixed state. The research also details unified approaches for perfect and imperfect quantum operations, including tasks like cloning and deleting. These operations are characterized by the linear independence of their input states. Additionally, new methods for superposition are developed, applicable to unknown pure states within finite collections and to situations where multiple copies of input states are accessible. The ultimate goal of this work is to foster a more profound understanding of quantum transformations and their limitations, derived from the principle of superposition.

**Paraphrase 3:**

This paper unveils new "no-go" theorems in quantum mechanics, effectively bringing together established principles like the no-cloning and no-deleting theorems. A significant contribution is the introduction of a "no-encoding" theorem, which declares the impossibility of linearly superposing an unknown pure state with a fixed state in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space through a universal quantum transformation. The authors further provide unified strategies for quantum tasks, both perfect and imperfect, such as cloning and deleting, with their performance being tied to the linear independence of the input states. Novel superposition schemes have also been devised for unknown pure states belonging to finite sets, and for instances where multiple copies of input states are available. The ultimate aim is to deepen the understanding of quantum transformations and their limitations, which are rooted in the superposition principle.

Unifying principles like the no-cloning and no-deleting theorems, this paper presents novel "no-go" theorems within quantum mechanics. A new "no-encoding" theorem is proposed, stipulating that a universal quantum transformation cannot achieve the linear superposition of an unknown pure state and a constant state in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. The work also outlines unified methodologies for both flawless and flawed quantum processes, such as cloning and deleting, which are distinguished by the linear independence of their input states. Furthermore, the authors have developed new superposition schemes for unknown pure states within finite sets and for scenarios involving the availability of multiple input state copies. Ultimately, this research seeks to offer a more advanced comprehension of quantum transformations and their constraints, as dictated by
