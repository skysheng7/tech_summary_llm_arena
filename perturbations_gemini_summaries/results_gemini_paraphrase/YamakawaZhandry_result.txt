Here's a paraphrased summary of the article:

The research paper introduces novel theoretical findings that establish quantum advantage for issues beyond those classified as NP-complete, thus proposing a less stringent prerequisite for quantum speedups compared to existing knowledge. Researchers have devised methods to offer definitive demonstrations of quantum properties through the use of random oracles. Furthermore, they have devised examples of cryptographic tools that remain secure from classical computing but are vulnerable to quantum attacks. These innovative constructions are made possible by employing error-correcting codes and harnessing the power of quantum Fourier transforms, with certain outcomes contingent upon the Aaronson-Ambainis conjecture. The paper also demonstrates the practical applicability of these theoretical frameworks by applying them to common cryptographic hash functions such as SHA2, indicating potential for novel cryptographic designs. In essence, this study questions the prevailing belief that substantial "structure" is invariably necessary for quantum advantage and delves into the distinctions between classical and quantum random oracle models.
