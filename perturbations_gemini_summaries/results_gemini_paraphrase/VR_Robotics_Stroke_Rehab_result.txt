Here are several paraphrased versions of the summary, using different wording and sentence structures while retaining all original information:

**Option 1 (Focus on findings):**

A pilot investigation explored whether virtual reality (VR) coupled with robotic therapy could effectively aid lower limb recovery in stroke survivors experiencing hemiplegia. Results indicated that the group receiving VR-based robotic training in addition to standard rehabilitation achieved statistically significant gains in lower limb motor function, surpassing the control group. Furthermore, those in the intervention group exhibited improvements in balance, walking capacity, daily activities, and overall quality of life. Conversely, no significant difference in global cognitive function was observed between the groups. The study suggests that VR-based robotic training presents a promising and viable option for stroke rehabilitation, warranting further large-scale research to confirm its efficacy.

**Option 2 (More concise):**

In this pilot study, the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) augmented by robotic training was assessed for hemiplegic stroke patients undergoing lower limb rehabilitation. The intervention group, which combined VR-robotic therapy with conventional methods, experienced statistically significant enhancements in lower limb motor function compared to a control group. Enhanced balance, gait, functional independence in daily tasks, and quality of life were also noted in the intervention group. However, global cognitive function did not show a significant improvement across the groups. The study concluded that VR-based robotic training is a feasible and promising strategy for stroke recovery, advocating for larger trials to validate these findings.

**Option 3 (Emphasizing the intervention):**

This pilot research examined the effectiveness of incorporating virtual reality (VR) and robotic training into the lower limb rehabilitation of stroke patients with hemiplegia. The findings revealed that the intervention group, which underwent VR-based robotic training alongside conventional rehabilitation, demonstrated statistically significant improvements in lower limb motor function compared to the control group. Participants who received the VR-robotic intervention also showed advancements in their balancing abilities, walking proficiency, performance of daily activities, and quality of life. No significant differences in global cognitive function were detected between the groups. The study concluded that VR-based robotic training represents a promising and feasible rehabilitation approach for stroke survivors, highlighting the necessity for larger studies to substantiate its effectiveness.

**Option 4 (Slightly more formal):**

The effectiveness of virtual reality (VR)-supported robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation in stroke patients with hemiplegia was the subject of this pilot study. The findings demonstrated that the intervention cohort, which engaged in VR-based robotic training concurrently with standard rehabilitation, achieved statistically significant advancements in lower limb motor function relative to the control group. Moreover, participants in the intervention group exhibited notable improvements in balance, ambulation, activities of daily living, and quality of life. However, global cognitive function did not exhibit significant change between the two groups. The study's conclusion is that VR-based robotic training is a promising and feasible intervention for stroke rehabilitation, underscoring the need for expanded studies to corroborate its efficacy.
