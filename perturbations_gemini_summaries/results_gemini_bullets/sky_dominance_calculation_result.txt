Here's the summary converted into bullet points:

*   This study investigated how competition levels affect dominance hierarchies in dairy cows.
*   Researchers found that as competition for feed increased (indicated by higher feeder occupancy), the dominance hierarchy became flatter.
*   This flattening occurred because subordinate cows became more successful in challenging dominant cows.
*   This led to more "2-way dyads" where both animals won interactions against each other.
*   The study suggests that during high competition, resource valuation can override intrinsic dominance attributes, influencing competitive success.
*   Therefore, it is recommended to consider the context of competition when assessing dominance hierarchies in dairy cows.
