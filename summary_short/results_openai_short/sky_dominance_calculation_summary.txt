This study tested whether dairy-cow dominance hierarchies inferred from feeder “replacement” events change with competition intensity, using 10 months of continuous sensor data from a dynamic group (48 cows at a time; 159 total). Competition was quantified as real-time feeder occupancy, and separate Elo-based hierarchies were built for 25 occupancy levels. As occupancy increased, hierarchy steepness consistently decreased (i.e., the hierarchy flattened), and more dyads became two-way (both cows sometimes displaced the other), indicating more reversals and less consistent dominance. At the highest occupancy, more dyads showed the initially dominant cow (defined at low occupancy) losing proportionally more, and the dominant’s win rate declined further as occupancy rose. The authors conclude that high competition (and high feed value) can override intrinsic dominance attributes, so hierarchies built only during peak competition periods (e.g., right after fresh feed delivery) may be misleading and should be contextualized.
