This paper proposes LightGCN, a simplified Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model for recommendation systems. The authors argue that existing GCN models for recommendation are overly complex and inherit operations that are not beneficial for the task, even degrading performance. Through ablation studies on NGCF, they demonstrate that feature transformation and nonlinear activation do not contribute to collaborative filtering effectiveness. LightGCN simplifies GCN by focusing solely on neighborhood aggregation and layer combination, which effectively captures user-item interactions and mitigates oversmoothing. Empirical results show that LightGCN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like NGCF, while being easier to train and more interpretable.
