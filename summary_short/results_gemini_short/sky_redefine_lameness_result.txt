This study proposes a novel method for assessing lameness in dairy cows by constructing a lameness hierarchy using crowd-sourced data and pairwise comparisons. The authors found that this method achieved high inter-observer reliability among experienced assessors and was feasible for untrained crowd workers from Amazon MTurk. By employing a 5-milestone subsampling algorithm, they demonstrated that only a small number of crowd workers and pairwise comparisons are needed to establish a reliable hierarchy. This approach offers a more granular and efficient alternative to traditional subjective gait scoring methods, laying the groundwork for creating large datasets to train robust automated lameness detection models. The study suggests that this method has wide-ranging applications beyond lameness assessment for labeling health-related data.
