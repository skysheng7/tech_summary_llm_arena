  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Clearly captures the paper’s core aim (how DHTs are used for stroke rehab in Canada and what gaps exist) and implicitly reflects the review’s guiding questions about use, gaps, and implications."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Key counts and proportions match the article: 14 studies (2010–2022), UE focus 85.71%, chronic phase 64.3%, home setting 50%. Technology categories listed are consistent with reported types (sensors, VR, games, telerehab, robots), though it omits some reported percentages for each technology category."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Coherent and readable with appropriate terminology; defines DHTs by expansion and context. Some terms (e.g., telerehabilitation vs. VR-based telerehab, “sensors” scope) are not explained, but this is acceptable for a 5-sentence constraint."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "Delivers exactly 5 sentences, matching the prompt requirement."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Covers study scope, main findings (focus areas, phase, setting, technology types), overall conclusions (feasibility/effectiveness), major barriers/facilitators, and key research gaps/future directions. Minor missing details include study design breakdown and the small attention to walking speed/sitting balance, but these are not essential for a 5-sentence summary."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "No clear fabricated claims; facilitators/barriers and gaps align with the discussion and conclusions. The claim that studies showed improvements in 'quality of life' is generally supported (some included studies report QoL-related outcomes), though not universal across all studies, making it a slight overgeneralization rather than a hallucination."
  },
  "total_score": 54,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is concise, well-structured, and strongly aligned with the paper’s purpose, main results, and identified gaps, while adhering perfectly to the 5-sentence constraint. It is largely numerically accurate and avoids unsupported claims, though it slightly overgeneralizes effectiveness/QoL impacts and omits some methodological detail that could nuance the findings."
