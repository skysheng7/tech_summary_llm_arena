  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Clearly states the study aim: evaluating effectiveness (and implicitly feasibility/safety) of VR-based robotic lower-limb training in stroke patients with hemiplegia versus conventional rehab."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Key design and main results are largely correct (pilot RCT; 4-week program; main outcomes; MD 6.5 vs 3.3; no adverse events). However, it misstates enrollment/group sizes: 42 were randomized (21/21), and 40 completed (20/20); the summary frames it as 42 patients with n=20 per group."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Coherent, logically ordered, and readable. Terminology is mostly appropriate, but it does not explain major measures/acronyms (e.g., FMA-LE, BBS, FAC, MoCA), which slightly reduces clarity for non-specialists."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "Follows the prompt by providing exactly 5 sentences (required 5; provided 5)."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Covers population, setting, intervention/control dosage, duration, primary findings across outcomes, safety, and need for larger studies. Minor omissions: assessor-blinded/open-label nature and the fully immersive VR detail, but these are not essential for a 5-sentence summary."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "No clear unsupported claims. The main issue is a small numerical mismatch (group sizes) rather than fabrication; otherwise statements align with the paper."
  },
  "total_score": 53,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is concise, well-structured, and captures the trial design, intervention dose, key outcomes, and safety findings while appropriately noting the preliminary nature of the evidence. Its main weakness is a participant-count inaccuracy (randomized 21/21; completed 20/20), and it could improve clarity by briefly naming/expanding the main outcome measures."
