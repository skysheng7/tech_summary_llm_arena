  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Clearly states the paper’s central aim: evaluating therapeutic effects of wearable robotic gloves on post-stroke hand function, aligning with the review’s objective."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Accurately reports key details: 5 databases searched up to September 2021, 5 included studies, sample sizes (3–13), no RCTs, intervention duration (4–6 weeks), and Downs & Black adapted scores (7–10/12). Minor nuance: it generalizes spasticity and chronic-focus across studies, though one study did not specify spasticity and one included subacute stroke."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Coherent and well-structured, using appropriate terms (systematic review, RCTs, spasticity, methodological quality). However, technical measures (e.g., Downs and Black checklist) and clinical terms (mild-moderate spasticity) are not briefly explained, which could help non-expert readers."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "Follows the prompt: provides a summary in exactly 5 sentences."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "Covers the major elements: objective, search scope, number of included studies, key limitations, devices included, intervention duration, and overall conclusion/recommendations. No major omissions for a 5-sentence constraint."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "No evident unsupported claims; all key assertions (counts, time frame, devices, limitations, scoring range) are grounded in the provided article text."
  },
  "total_score": 56,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is concise, coherent, and highly faithful to the article, capturing the research question, methods, main findings, limitations, and conclusions within the 5-sentence constraint. Minor overgeneralization occurs regarding patient characteristics (spasticity reporting and chronic vs. subacute mix), but it does not materially distort the paper’s conclusions."
