  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Accurately captures the central question: whether one can obtain verifiable (NP-search / publicly verifiable) quantum advantage relative to a structureless oracle (random oracle) and with Minicrypt-style instantiations, contrasting with prior structured-oracle/algebraic approaches."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Major claims align with the paper: NP-search separation relative to a random oracle, classical-secure/quantum-insecure OWF/CRHF-style counterexamples, publicly verifiable PoQ with minimal rounds, and certifiable randomness assuming Aaronson–Ambainis. Minor imprecision: the paper’s collision-resistant construction is a compressing function collision-resistant in CROM (and keyed AI-CROM) but 'easily inverted quantumly,' and the summary glosses over these qualifiers and the distinction between CROM vs QROM vs AI variants."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 7,
    "reasoning": "Coherent and uses appropriate terms (random oracle, NP search, proofs of quantumness, Aaronson–Ambainis, folded Reed–Solomon, list-recoverability, QFT). However, it gives little explanation of key nuances (uniform vs non-uniform adversaries, CROM/QROM distinction, what 'publicly verifiable' entails) and reads more like bullets than an integrated explanation."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "Did not follow the '5 sentences' requirement. The response includes a heading, an introductory sentence fragment plus 'The key results include:' and then 5 numbered bullet items; overall it is not 5 sentences (it is 7+ sentence-like units and uses list formatting instead of a 5-sentence paragraph)."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Covers the paper’s primary contributions and core technique (code-based construction + QFT-based quantum inverter + classical list-recovery hardness). It omits some discussion points (e.g., why results don’t contradict Aaronson–Ambainis due to search vs decision; remarks about PRGs not necessarily separating; SHA2 instantiation motivation), but those are secondary for a short summary."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "No clear unsupported claims. The mention of 'folded Reed–Solomon codes with list-recoverability' and QFT-based preimage finding matches the overview, and the Aaronson–Ambainis assumption for certifiable randomness is correctly attributed. Any missing qualifiers are more omissions than hallucinations."
  },
  "total_score": 42,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary accurately reflects the paper’s main thrust and key results, including the NP-search quantum advantage relative to a random oracle and the publicly verifiable proofs of quantumness, and it correctly highlights the folded Reed–Solomon/list-recovery + QFT technical backbone. Its main weakness is prompt noncompliance: it is not a 5-sentence summary and relies on bullet points rather than a concise five-sentence narrative, with some nuance about security models and qualifiers glossed over."
