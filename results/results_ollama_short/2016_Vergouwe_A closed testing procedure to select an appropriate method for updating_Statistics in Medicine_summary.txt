Here is a summary of the article in 5 sentences:

The authors present a closed testing procedure to select an updated predictive model from a set of candidate models. The procedure involves comparing each candidate model's performance on a test dataset and selecting the best-performing one. The approach is demonstrated using four different scenarios, including updating a model for kidney graft survival and predicting bacterial meningitis in children. The results show that the closed testing procedure can effectively identify the most accurate model, even when there are multiple models with similar performance. The authors conclude that this procedure can be a useful tool for updating predictive models in various medical applications.
