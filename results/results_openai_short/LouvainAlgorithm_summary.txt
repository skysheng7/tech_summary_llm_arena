Blondel, Guillaume, Lambiotte, and Lefebvre propose a fast heuristic for detecting communities in very large networks by optimizing modularity. The algorithm iteratively alternates between (1) locally moving individual nodes to neighboring communities when it increases modularity and (2) aggregating the resulting communities into a smaller “meta-network,” repeating these passes to build a hierarchy of communities. Because modularity gains can be computed efficiently and the network shrinks quickly after each aggregation, the method runs extremely fast in practice, scaling to networks with tens to hundreds of millions of nodes where earlier methods fail. Experiments show it achieves higher or comparable modularity than prominent alternatives while being orders of magnitude faster, and it also provides meaningful intermediate (multi-resolution) partitions. Applied to a Belgian mobile-phone network, it reveals communities that align strongly with language groups, demonstrating both the method’s practical validity and its ability to expose hierarchical structure.
