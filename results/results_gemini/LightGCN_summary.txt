This paper introduces LightGCN, a simplified yet powerful Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model for collaborative filtering recommendation. The authors argue that common GCN operations like feature transformation and nonlinear activation are not only unnecessary but also detrimental to recommendation performance. They demonstrate through ablation studies that removing these operations significantly improves accuracy. LightGCN retains only the core neighborhood aggregation mechanism of GCN, linearly propagating embeddings on the user-item interaction graph. This simplified model is easier to train, more interpretable, and achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing GCN-based methods like NGCF.
