This scoping review explored the use of digital health technologies (DHTs) for stroke rehabilitation in Canada between 2010 and 2022. The review identified 14 studies, primarily focusing on upper extremity function during the chronic phase of stroke, with common technologies including virtual reality, gaming systems, and mobile/sensor-based training. Key findings indicate that DHTs are feasible and effective, improving patient outcomes and offering potential to overcome access barriers, especially in rural areas. However, challenges such as technical limitations, user inexperience, and a lack of clinician involvement need to be addressed for widespread adoption. Future Canadian research should prioritize high-quality RCTs, broaden outcome targets beyond UE function, and investigate DHT use in earlier stroke phases, considering diverse populations.
