# Summary of "On the 12th Day of Christmas, a Statistician Sent to Me..."

This BMJ article presents 12 common statistical errors frequently encountered by The BMJ's statistical editors during peer review, framed as a Christmas-themed guide for researchers.

The 12 key recommendations are: (1) clarify research questions and estimands, (2) focus on estimates and confidence intervals rather than just p-values, (3) properly account for missing data, (4) avoid dichotomizing continuous variables, (5) consider non-linear relationships, (6) quantify differences in subgroup results, (7) account for data clustering, (8) interpret I² and meta-regression appropriately, (9) assess calibration in prediction models, (10) carefully consider variable selection approaches, (11) assess the impact of statistical assumptions, and (12) use reporting guidelines and avoid overinterpretation.

The authors emphasize that statistical significance doesn't equal clinical significance, and that "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence." They stress the importance of complete reporting using established guidelines like CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA, and TRIPOD.

The article aims to help researchers avoid common pitfalls and reduce the burden on statistical reviewers during the Christmas period when submission volumes surge.
