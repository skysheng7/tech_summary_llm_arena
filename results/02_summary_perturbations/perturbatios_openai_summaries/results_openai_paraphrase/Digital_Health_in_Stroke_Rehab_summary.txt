Here's a paraphrased version of the summary, using different wording and sentence structure while retaining all original information:

A scoping review was conducted to investigate the application of digital health technologies (DHTs) in stroke rehabilitation within Canada, as well as to identify existing deficits that could inform clinical, research, and policy decisions. Through comprehensive searches of both academic databases and grey literature, the researchers pinpointed 14 Canadian research studies published from 2010 to 2022. These studies encompassed various methodologies, including qualitative research and randomized controlled trials. The majority of the identified research focused on individuals in the chronic stage of stroke, with a primary emphasis on the rehabilitation of the upper extremities. The delivery settings for these interventions were predominantly either at home or within healthcare institutions. The most frequently investigated DHTs included sensor-based and mobile tools, virtual reality and telerehabilitation approaches (such as exergames), gaming consoles, and, to a lesser extent, robotic devices. While many studies reported positive findings regarding feasibility, strong participant engagement, and enhancements in functional capabilities, they also highlighted challenges such as technical difficulties, issues with user-friendliness, and limitations related to access and training. The researchers concluded that DHTs hold considerable potential for enhancing stroke rehabilitation services in Canada. Nevertheless, they emphasized the necessity for more robust clinical trials and a wider scope of outcome measurement (including aspects like cognitive function, lower limb function, activities of daily living, mental well-being, and interventions for earlier stroke recovery phases) to facilitate fair and widespread adoption.
