A pilot study, employing an assessor-blinded randomized controlled design, investigated the efficacy of integrating fully immersive virtual reality (VR) with a lower-limb rehabilitation robot for enhancing recovery in stroke survivors experiencing hemiplegia. Participants were divided into two groups: one receiving VR-based robotic training alongside conventional rehabilitation, and the other receiving conventional rehabilitation exclusively, over a 4-week period (30 minutes daily, 5 days weekly). Of the initial 42 participants, 40 concluded the study. The group that underwent VR-robot intervention demonstrated statistically significant enhancements in lower-limb motor function, as evidenced by a greater change in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Lower Extremities (FMA-LE) of 6.5 compared to 3.3 (p<0.001). Furthermore, this group also exhibited superior outcomes in balance (assessed by the Berg Balance Scale - BBS), walking proficiency (measured by the Functional Ambulation Categories - FAC), capabilities in performing daily tasks (via the Barthel Index), and overall quality of life pertaining to stroke (with all these measures showing p<0.05). While global cognitive function, as evaluated by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), improved in both participant groups, there was no significant difference observed between them (p=0.873). The study reported no adverse events, leading the researchers to conclude that this combined approach is both feasible and shows potential, though further extensive and extended trials are necessary to validate its effectiveness and practicality.
