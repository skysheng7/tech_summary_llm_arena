The recently created and verified PRECISE-X prediction model has been developed to gauge the likelihood of a person's initial severe COPD exacerbation necessitating hospitalization. This tool is particularly valuable because it addresses a need for risk assessment when a patient's history of previous exacerbations is not yet known at the time of diagnosis. Drawing upon UK CPRD Aurum primary care data spanning from 2004 to 2022, and including 219,015 individuals newly diagnosed with COPD, the model forecasts risk over two distinct periods: a primary 5-year timeframe and a secondary 12-month timeframe. Its predictions are based on commonly collected clinical variables, with four essential predictors being age, sex, MRC dyspnoea score, and FEV₁. Additionally, the model can integrate 28 optional predictors, such as smoking status, other health conditions, previous hospitalizations or emergency department visits, eosinophil counts, and the use of inhaler medications. Through an internal-external cross-validation process conducted across nine different regions in the UK, PRECISE-X demonstrated strong predictive accuracy and consistent calibration. Specifically, it achieved a c-statistic of 0.836 for the 5-year prediction and 0.756 for the 1-year prediction. Furthermore, the model generally offered a positive net benefit across a broad spectrum of decision thresholds. The researchers suggest that PRECISE-X has the potential to facilitate earlier risk stratification and proactive management of COPD, although they emphasize the necessity of external validation studies outside of the UK.
