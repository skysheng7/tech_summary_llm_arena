Researchers developed a model to forecast serious COPD flare-ups necessitating hospitalization, utilizing administrative health information from British Columbia collected between 1997 and 2016. This population-surveillance tool calculates a COPD patient's likelihood of being hospitalized within the next two months, based on their health history from the preceding six months, while disregarding very recent readmissions after discharge. The study evaluated several predictive approaches – logistic regression, random forest, neural networks, and gradient boosting – and conducted temporal validation on data from a subsequent period. Gradient boosting emerged as the top-performing method, achieving an AUC of 0.82 during validation, significantly outperforming a baseline model that only considered past exacerbations (AUC 0.68) and demonstrating strong calibration. The findings indicate that readily available administrative data can effectively identify individuals at elevated risk, paving the way for focused preventative measures and widespread outreach initiatives.
