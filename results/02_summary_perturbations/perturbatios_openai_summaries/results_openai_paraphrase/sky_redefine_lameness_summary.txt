Here are a few paraphrased versions of the summary, using different wording and sentence structures while retaining all the original information:

**Version 1:**

Instead of relying on subjective 5-point scales to assess lameness in dairy cows, this article suggests a crowd-sourced method that uses pairwise comparisons to create a continuous "lameness hierarchy." This ranking system, termed EloSteepness, employs a Bayesian Elo-based technique. In an initial trial with 30 videos featuring cows walking (totaling 435 video pairs), hierarchies constructed by experts demonstrated strong agreement among them (ICC = 0.81). In contrast, conventional gait scoring exhibited considerably lower consistency, with intra-observer reliability around 0.62 and inter-observer reliability approximately 0.44. When untrained individuals from Amazon Mechanical Turk were engaged, they generated a hierarchy that closely mirrored that of the experts (ICC = 0.85). This agreement was robust for pairs with evident differences but less so for subtle distinctions. Furthermore, the researchers devised a subsampling algorithm based on milestones, which reduced the number of comparisons by at least 61%. They determined that approximately 8 crowd workers per pair were adequate for achieving a consistent and dependable hierarchy. The authors conclude that this approach offers an economical and reliable means to generate the extensive, detailed labeled data required to develop accurate automated lameness detection models for practical farm application.

**Version 2:**

The study advocates for moving away from subjective 5-point lameness scoring in dairy cows toward a crowd-driven, pairwise comparison system that establishes a continuous "lameness hierarchy." This ranking is achieved through a Bayesian Elo-based methodology called EloSteepness. A pilot study involving 30 videos of cows walking, which generated 435 pairwise comparisons, revealed that expert-developed hierarchies had high inter-observer reliability (ICC = 0.81). This contrasted sharply with traditional gait scoring, which showed significantly less consistency (intra-observer ICC ≈ 0.62; inter-observer ICC ≈ 0.44). A hierarchy created by untrained crowd workers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk closely aligned with expert rankings (ICC = 0.85), although the agreement was stronger for obvious differences between pairs and weaker for subtle ones. The researchers also created a milestone-driven subsampling method that cut down on comparisons by at least 61%. They found that roughly 8 crowd workers were needed for each pair to produce a stable and reliable hierarchy. The authors assert that this method provides a cost-effective and dependable way to produce the large, finely-grained labeled datasets necessary for training effective automated lameness detection models for real-world farm use.

**Version 3:**

This article proposes an alternative to subjective 5-point gait scoring for dairy cow lameness: a crowd-enabled pairwise comparison approach that generates a continuous "lameness hierarchy." This ranking is accomplished using a Bayesian Elo-based technique called EloSteepness. In a preliminary dataset of 30 cow-walking videos, resulting in 435 video pairs, expert-constructed hierarchies demonstrated high inter-observer reliability (ICC = 0.81). In contrast, conventional gait scoring proved much less consistent, with intra-observer ICC averaging about 0.62 and inter-observer ICC around 0.44. Untrained crowd workers, sourced through Amazon Mechanical Turk, produced a
