Here's a paraphrased version of the summary, using different wording and sentence structure without altering the information:

Yamakawa and Zhandry demonstrate that certain NP *search* problems exist for which quantum polynomial-time algorithms are capable of finding solutions, whereas any classical probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm, even one with unlimited computational power but restricted to polynomial *classical* oracle queries, would be unable to do so. Their work introduces a *publicly verifiable* method for proving quantumness that requires minimal interaction: it's non-interactive when dealing with uniform adversaries and uses a two-message public-coin system for non-uniform adversaries (who possess oracle-dependent advice). Applying these same principles, they devise cryptographic separations. These separations show that specific cryptographic building blocks, such as one-way functions and even hash functions resistant to collisions, which are secure against classical attackers bound by query limits, become easily breakable by quantum attackers. Furthermore, they provide additional counterexamples for digital signatures and CPA-secure public-key encryption (the latter contingent on the existence of a classically CPA-secure scheme). Their constructions achieve this by integrating outputs from a random oracle with the robust error-correction capabilities of list-recoverable codes, making classical inversion unfeasible. Simultaneously, a quantum Fourier transform-based technique enables efficient sampling of preimages. They contend that these findings do not conflict with the Aaronson–Ambainis conjecture (which pertains to decision problems). Moreover, under the assumption of this conjecture, they also develop minimally interactive, publicly verifiable protocols for "certifiable randomness." By substituting the random oracle with a practical hash function such as SHA-2, they achieve plausible "Minicrypt-style" implementations that do not necessitate complex algebraic structures.
