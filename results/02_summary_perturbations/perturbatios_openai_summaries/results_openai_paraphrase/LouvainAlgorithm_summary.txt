A rapid heuristic for identifying communities in massive networks is put forth by Blondel, Guillaume, Lambiotte, and Lefebvre. Their approach focuses on maximizing modularity through an iterative process. This process involves two main steps: first, individual nodes are repositioned into adjacent communities if this move enhances modularity; second, the newly formed communities are consolidated into a reduced "meta-network." This cycle is repeated to construct a layered community structure. The algorithm's efficiency stems from the swift calculation of modularity improvements and the rapid reduction in network size following each aggregation. Consequently, it operates with exceptional speed, capable of handling networks with tens to hundreds of millions of nodes, a scale beyond the reach of prior techniques. Empirical results indicate that this method yields modularity scores equal to or exceeding those of well-known alternatives, while being significantly faster – by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, it generates useful intermediate (multi-resolution) divisions of the network. When applied to a Belgian mobile-phone network, the algorithm uncovered communities that closely corresponded to linguistic groups, thus validating the method's practical applicability and its capacity for revealing hierarchical organization.
