A comprehensive review of the literature up to September 2021 investigated the impact of wearable robotic gloves on hand function restoration for stroke survivors. After an extensive search of prominent databases yielding 2674 entries, only five small-scale studies, involving between 3 and 13 participants each, were deemed suitable for inclusion. These studies predominantly focused on individuals in the chronic or subacute stages of stroke recovery. Crucially, all five studies reported positive outcomes regarding hand and upper limb function following training with these robotic gloves.

The specific devices examined included EPHO, PneuGlove, X-Glove, HandinMind, and IronHand. These devices generally aimed to enhance finger extension or grip strength and task execution. The training protocols typically involved task-oriented practice, often integrated with gamified or virtual reality exercises, and spanned a duration of 4 to 6 weeks. The methodological quality of these studies was assessed as moderate, scoring between 7 and 10 out of 12 on an adapted Downs and Black checklist. However, significant limitations were identified, including the absence of randomized controlled trials, the lack of control groups, and the restricted sample sizes. Furthermore, participant characteristics, such as the severity of spasticity, were not extensively detailed.

In their conclusions, the researchers noted that despite the encouraging findings, the current evidence base lacks a standardized approach to the intervention itself and its optimal timing. Consequently, the authors emphasized the necessity for larger, more robust comparative studies to definitively ascertain the therapeutic benefits of these devices.
