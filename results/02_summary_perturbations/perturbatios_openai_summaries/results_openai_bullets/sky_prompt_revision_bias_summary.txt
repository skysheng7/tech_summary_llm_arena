Here's the summary converted into bullet points:

*   OpenAI’s DALL‑E 3 depicts intensive livestock farming by automatically revising prompts.
*   This automatic prompt revision tends to "romanticize" dairy and pig farms.
*   The romanticization adds pastoral details, resulting in outdoor, idyllic imagery.
*   Even with explicit requests for "typical" or "accurate" depictions of dairy and pig farms, DALL-E 3 produced mostly pasture/mud scenes.
*   These pasture/mud scenes conflict with common modern practices in industrialized countries, where animals are largely housed indoors.
*   When a workaround to inhibit prompt revision was used, generated images shifted significantly towards indoor confinement scenes.
*   Examples of indoor confinement scenes include cows at feed barriers/headlocks and pigs behind metal railings on concrete.
*   Regional prompts (North America, Europe, Oceania) produced pastoral outputs by default.
*   With prompt revision suppressed, some country-level differences emerged in generated images.
*   These country-level differences partially tracked real-world housing patterns.
*   The authors argue that hidden prompt rewriting can systematically erase controversial realities.
*   They also state that this rewriting can reinforce mis- or disinformation.
*   The authors recommend greater transparency and auditability of prompt revision.
*   They also recommend providing users with options to see or disable prompt revision.
