Here's the summary converted into bullet points, preserving all information:

*   **Study Design:** Pilot, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial.
*   **Objective:** To test if fully immersive virtual reality (VR) combined with a lower-limb rehabilitation robot could improve recovery in stroke patients with hemiplegia.
*   **Participants:** 42 stroke patients with hemiplegia.
*   **Randomization:** Patients were randomized into two groups.
*   **Intervention Groups:**
    *   VR-based robotic training plus conventional rehabilitation.
    *   Conventional rehabilitation alone.
*   **Intervention Duration:** 4 weeks.
*   **Intervention Frequency and Duration:** 30 minutes per day, 5 days per week.
*   **Study Completion:** 40 patients completed the study.
*   **Key Findings (VR-robot group vs. conventional alone):**
    *   **Lower-limb motor function:** Significantly greater improvement (FMA-LE change 6.5 vs 3.3; p<0.001).
    *   **Balance:** Better improvement (p<0.05).
    *   **Walking ability:** Better improvement (p<0.05).
    *   **Activities of daily living:** Better improvement (p<0.05).
    *   **Stroke-specific quality of life:** Better improvement (p<0.05).
*   **Cognitive Function:**
    *   Global cognitive function (MoCA) improved within both groups.
    *   No significant difference in MoCA improvement between groups (p=0.873).
*   **Adverse Events:** No adverse events were reported.
*   **Authors' Conclusion:** The approach is feasible and promising.
*   **Recommendations:** Larger, longer-term trials are needed to confirm effectiveness and practicality.
