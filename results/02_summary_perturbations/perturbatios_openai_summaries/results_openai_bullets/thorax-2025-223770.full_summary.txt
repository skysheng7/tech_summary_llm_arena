Here is the summary converted into bullet points, preserving all information:

*   **PRECISE-X is a newly developed and validated prediction model.**
*   **Its purpose is to estimate the risk of a first severe COPD exacerbation requiring hospitalisation.**
*   **It addresses a gap where prior exacerbation history is not yet available at diagnosis.**
*   **The model uses UK CPRD Aurum primary care data (2004–2022).**
*   **Data is from 219,015 newly diagnosed COPD patients.**
*   **The model predicts risk over 5 years (primary) and 12 months (secondary).**
*   **Predictions are based on routine clinical variables.**
*   **The model requires four core predictors: age, sex, MRC dyspnoea score, and FEV₁. **
*   **It can incorporate 28 additional optional predictors.**
*   **Examples of optional predictors include: smoking status, comorbidities, prior admissions/ED visits, eosinophils, and inhaler therapies.**
*   **The model underwent internal-external cross-validation across nine UK regions.**
*   **It demonstrated strong discrimination and robust calibration.**
*   **Discrimination metrics: c-statistic of 0.836 for 5-year prediction and 0.756 for 1-year prediction.**
*   **It generally showed positive net benefit across a wide range of decision thresholds.**
*   **The authors conclude that PRECISE-X can support earlier risk stratification and proactive COPD management.**
*   **Independent validation outside the UK is still needed.**
