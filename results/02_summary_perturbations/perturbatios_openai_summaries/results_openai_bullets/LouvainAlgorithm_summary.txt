Here's the summary converted into bullet points, preserving all information:

*   Blondel, Guillaume, Lambiotte, and Lefebvre propose a fast heuristic for detecting communities in very large networks by optimizing modularity.
*   The algorithm iteratively alternates between two steps:
    *   Locally moving individual nodes to neighboring communities when this movement increases modularity.
    *   Aggregating the resulting communities into a smaller “meta-network.”
*   These passes are repeated to build a hierarchy of communities.
*   The method runs extremely fast in practice due to:
    *   Efficient computation of modularity gains.
    *   Rapid network shrinkage after each aggregation.
*   It scales to networks with tens to hundreds of millions of nodes, where earlier methods fail.
*   Experiments demonstrate the method achieves higher or comparable modularity than prominent alternatives.
*   It is orders of magnitude faster than prominent alternatives.
*   The method provides meaningful intermediate (multi-resolution) partitions.
*   Applied to a Belgian mobile-phone network, it reveals communities that align strongly with language groups.
*   This application demonstrates both the method’s practical validity and its ability to expose hierarchical structure.
