Here's the summary converted into bullet points, preserving all information and adding nothing new:

*   The paper aims for a unified perspective on quantum "no-go" results originating from linearity/superposition, such as no-cloning, no-deleting, and no-superposing.
*   A "no-encoding" theorem is presented, demonstrating that no universal completely positive map can generate a nontrivial linear superposition of an arbitrary unknown pure state with a fixed state in finite dimensions.
*   The "no-encoding" theorem is shown to generalize to encompass the standard no-cloning and no-deleting theorems as special cases.
*   A one-shot framework is provided, unifying perfect and imperfect versions of cloning and deleting when inputs are limited to a finite set.
*   The feasibility within this one-shot framework is precisely characterized by the linear independence of the candidate input states.
*   General upper bounds on achievable success probabilities are derived using matrix-norm/metric inequalities, extending existing bounds from probabilistic cloning and state discrimination.
*   Constructive protocols are proposed for superposing unknown states drawn from restricted sets, including finite sets and "fixed-overlap" style conditions.
*   These superposition schemes are generalized for situations where multiple copies of the input states are available.
