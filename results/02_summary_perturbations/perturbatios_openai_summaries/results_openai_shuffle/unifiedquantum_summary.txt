Here's the reordered summary, keeping the original sentence content intact:

The paper seeks a unified perspective on several quantum “no-go” results that stem from linearity/superposition, including no-cloning, no-deleting, and no-superposing. It introduces a “no-encoding” theorem showing that no universal completely positive map can produce a nontrivial linear superposition of an arbitrary unknown pure state with a fixed state (in finite dimension), and shows how this generalizes to recover the standard no-cloning and no-deleting theorems as special cases. Beyond impossibility results, the authors give a one-shot framework that unifies perfect and imperfect versions of cloning and deleting when inputs are restricted to a finite set, with feasibility characterized exactly by linear independence of the candidate input states. They derive general upper bounds on achievable success probabilities using matrix-norm/metric inequalities, extending known bounds from probabilistic cloning and state discrimination. Finally, they propose constructive protocols for superposing unknown states drawn from restricted sets (including finite sets and “fixed-overlap” style conditions) and generalize these superposition schemes when multiple copies of the input states are available.
