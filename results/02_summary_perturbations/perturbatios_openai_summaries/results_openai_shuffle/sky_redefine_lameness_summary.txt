The article proposes replacing subjective 5-point gait scoring for dairy cow lameness with a crowd-enabled, pairwise comparison approach that ranks cows into a continuous “lameness hierarchy” using a Bayesian Elo-based method (EloSteepness). In a pilot dataset of 30 cow-walking videos (435 video pairs), expert-built hierarchies showed high inter-observer reliability (ICC = 0.81), while traditional gait scoring was much less consistent (intra-observer ICC ≈ 0.62; inter-observer ICC ≈ 0.44). Untrained crowd workers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk produced a hierarchy that closely matched experts (ICC = 0.85), though agreement was strong for clearly different pairs and weak for subtle differences. The authors also developed a milestone-based subsampling algorithm that reduced comparisons by at least 61% and found that about 8 crowd workers per pair were sufficient to obtain a stable, reliable hierarchy. They conclude that this method can cheaply and reliably generate large, granular labeled datasets needed to train robust automated lameness detection models for real-farm use.
