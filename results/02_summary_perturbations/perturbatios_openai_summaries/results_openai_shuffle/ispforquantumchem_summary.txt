The paper presents an end-to-end workflow for preparing high-quality initial states for quantum energy estimation algorithms in quantum chemistry, emphasizing that initial-state quality strongly affects total runtime. It introduces a new, practical quality metric—the state’s **energy distribution** over the Hamiltonian spectrum—and provides classical and quantum methods (series expansions, a resolvent/Green’s-function approach, and coarse QPE sampling) to approximate it without knowing the true ground state. For implementation, the authors develop a more efficient fault-tolerant algorithm to load **sums of Slater determinants** with Toffoli cost scaling as \(O(D\log D)\), improving over prior \(O(ND)\)-type approaches, and they also analyze costs for preparing **matrix product states**. They propose **low-precision (coarse) QPE with postselection** as a cheap “refinement” step to filter out high-energy components and to diagnose/mitigate QPE “leakage” (spurious low-energy outcomes caused by kernel tails). Numerical studies on hydrogen chains, stretched N\(_2\), Cr\(_2\), and Fe\(_4\)S\(_4\) show that better initial states—often from DMRG/SHCI and sometimes compressed—can reduce the overall cost of energy estimation by orders of magnitude and help identify “Goldilocks” instances where quantum advantage is most plausible.
