Here's the reordered summary:

The article humorously describes how The BMJ’s statistical editors, especially during the Christmas submission rush, repeatedly encounter the same avoidable statistical and reporting problems in manuscripts.
It presents “12 days of Christmas” as 12 common issues, starting with clearly defining the research question and estimand and emphasizing effect estimates, confidence intervals, and clinical relevance rather than just P values.
It highlights frequent methodological pitfalls such as mishandling missing data, dichotomising continuous variables, assuming linear relationships when they may be non-linear, and making untested claims about subgroup differences.
It also warns about failing to account for clustering, misinterpreting meta-analysis heterogeneity statistics (like I²) and overusing meta-regression, and inadequately evaluating prediction models—especially calibration and overfitting.
Finally, it urges authors to check assumptions with sensitivity analyses, avoid questionable variable selection practices, follow appropriate reporting guidelines (e.g., CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA, TRIPOD), and avoid overinterpretation or “spin.”
