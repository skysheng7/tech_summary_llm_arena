Here's the reordered summary:

This study used British Columbia administrative health data (1997–2016) to build a population-surveillance model that predicts severe COPD exacerbations requiring hospitalization. For each patient with diagnosed COPD, predictors from the prior 6 months were used to estimate the risk of a COPD hospitalization in the following 2 months, excluding recent post-discharge readmissions. The authors compared logistic regression, random forest, neural networks, and gradient boosting, and performed temporal validation on a later time period. Gradient boosting performed best, achieving an AUC of 0.82 in validation (vs 0.68 for a reference model using only prior exacerbation history) and showed good calibration. The results suggest routinely collected administrative data can accurately flag high-risk individuals for targeted preventive interventions and scalable outreach programs.
