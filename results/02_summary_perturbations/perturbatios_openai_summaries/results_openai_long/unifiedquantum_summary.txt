This paper embarks on a journey to find a single, overarching conceptual framework that can encompass and explain a variety of quantum phenomena that are fundamentally impossible to achieve. These inherent limitations, often referred to as quantum "no-go" results, arise directly from the core principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the linearity of quantum operations and the principle of superposition. The authors' ambition is to present a unified perspective on a collection of these impossibility theorems, including well-known results like the no-cloning theorem, the no-deleting theorem, and theorems related to the inability to arbitrarily superpose states.

A central contribution of the paper is the introduction of a novel theorem they term the "no-encoding" theorem. This theorem establishes a profound impossibility: it demonstrates that it is not possible for any universal quantum operation, which must be completely positive, to create a non-trivial linear superposition involving an arbitrary, unknown pure quantum state and a predetermined, fixed quantum state. This impossibility holds true within a finite dimensional quantum system. The authors meticulously explain how this newly introduced "no-encoding" theorem acts as a more general principle. They demonstrate that by considering specific, special instances of this "no-encoding" theorem, one can effectively derive and recover the established, standard no-cloning and no-deleting theorems. In essence, these well-known impossibilities are shown to be particular manifestations of this broader, more fundamental limitation.

Moving beyond solely demonstrating what is impossible, the paper also presents a new theoretical framework, termed a "one-shot" framework. This framework is designed to provide a unified approach to understanding both perfect and imperfect versions of quantum cloning and quantum deletion. This unified perspective is achieved when the input quantum states are limited to belonging to a finite, predefined set. Within this framework, the authors pinpoint the exact conditions under which such operations are feasible. They reveal that feasibility is precisely characterized by a specific mathematical property: the linear independence of the candidate input states that one is attempting to clone or delete.

Furthermore, the authors delve into the quantitative aspects of these operations, even when they are not perfect. They derive general upper bounds on the achievable probabilities of success for these cloning and deleting operations. These bounds are obtained through the application of inequalities related to matrix norms and metrics. This aspect of their work extends and improves upon existing bounds that have been established for probabilistic cloning and for the challenging task of distinguishing between quantum states.

In the final section of the paper, the authors shift their focus to constructing practical, concrete quantum protocols. They propose methods for achieving the superposition of unknown quantum states, but with the important constraint that these unknown states are drawn from restricted sets. These restricted sets include finite sets of states, as well as conditions described as "fixed-overlap" style constraints. The authors further enhance these superposition schemes by exploring and generalizing them to scenarios where multiple copies of the input quantum states are available, thereby offering more robust and potentially more successful approaches to state superposition.
