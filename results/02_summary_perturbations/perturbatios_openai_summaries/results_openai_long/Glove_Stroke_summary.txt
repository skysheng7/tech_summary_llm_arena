Here's a longer, more redundant rewrite of the summary, restating ideas and adding explanations without introducing new facts:

This systematic review meticulously investigated the question of whether the use of wearable robotic gloves can lead to enhancements in hand function among individuals who have experienced a stroke. To achieve this, a comprehensive search of the most significant and widely recognized academic databases was conducted, with the search scope extending up to the month of September in the year 2021. This extensive search process yielded a substantial initial volume of information, resulting in the identification of 2674 distinct records. However, upon a thorough and detailed examination of these records against predetermined inclusion criteria, it was found that a very small number of these records actually met the necessary standards for inclusion in the review. Specifically, only five studies were deemed suitable for in-depth analysis.

These five included studies were characterized by their limited participant numbers, with each study enrolling between just three and thirteen individuals. The majority of the participants in these studies had experienced strokes that were either in the chronic phase, meaning long past the initial event, or the subacute phase, which refers to the period following the acute stroke but before full recovery. Across all of these five studies, a consistent and positive trend was observed: they all reported discernible improvements in various aspects of hand and upper-limb function following the implementation of training regimens that incorporated the use of these robotic gloves.

The specific wearable robotic glove devices that were examined within these studies encompassed a range of technologies, including those named EPHO, PneuGlove, X-Glove, HandinMind, and IronHand. The fundamental design and intended purpose of these devices generally revolved around facilitating or assisting with finger extension movements, or in improving the ability to perform gripping actions and specific functional tasks. The therapeutic approach employed in these studies typically involved a form of practice that was oriented towards real-world tasks, often referred to as task-oriented practice. In addition to this, or in conjunction with it, the training sometimes incorporated the use of engaging game-based exercises or virtual reality simulations, aiming to make the rehabilitation process more interactive and motivating. The duration of these training interventions was generally in the range of four to six weeks.

In terms of the methodological rigor of the studies that were included, their quality was assessed as being moderate. This assessment was based on scores ranging from 7 to 10 out of a possible 12 points, utilizing an adapted version of the well-established Downs and Black checklist, which is a standard tool for evaluating the quality of research studies. It is important to note, however, that the reviewed studies did not include any randomized controlled trials, which are considered the gold standard for research. Furthermore, none of the studies incorporated control groups, meaning there was no group of participants who did not receive the intervention to serve as a comparison. The sample sizes within each study were also quite limited, and there was a lack of detailed characterization of the participants, such as specific information regarding the severity of their spasticity, which is a common complication after stroke.

Consequently, the authors of this systematic review have arrived at a conclusion that, while the preliminary findings from these studies are indeed promising and suggest a potential benefit, there are significant limitations that need to be addressed. Specifically, the review highlights that there is currently no clearly defined or standardized approach for implementing these interventions, nor is there a consensus on the optimal timing for their application
