Here's a rewritten summary, expanded with restated ideas and redundant explanations, without introducing new facts:

This pilot study was a randomized controlled trial, and importantly, it was assessor-blinded. The primary objective of this research was to investigate a specific combination of therapeutic interventions for stroke patients who were experiencing hemiplegia, which is paralysis or weakness on one side of the body. Specifically, the study aimed to determine if the integration of fully immersive virtual reality (VR) technology, when used in conjunction with a lower-limb rehabilitation robot, could lead to enhanced recovery outcomes for these individuals.

The investigation involved a cohort of forty-two stroke patients who were suffering from hemiplegia. These participants were then randomly assigned into one of two treatment groups. One group received a program that incorporated VR-based robotic training alongside their conventional rehabilitation. The other group, serving as a control, received only conventional rehabilitation. This therapeutic intervention period lasted for a duration of four weeks. For both groups, the daily treatment sessions were scheduled for 30 minutes, and these sessions took place five days out of each week. Ultimately, forty of the initially recruited forty-two patients successfully completed the entire study protocol.

The results of the study indicated that the group that engaged in the VR-robot training exhibited notably superior advancements in their lower-limb motor function. This improvement was quantified by a significant difference in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Lower Extremity (FMA-LE) change scores, with the VR-robot group showing an increase of 6.5 compared to the control group's 3.3. This difference was statistically significant, with a p-value of less than 0.001. Beyond this primary outcome, the VR-robot intervention group also demonstrated more favorable results in several other key areas of recovery. These included improvements in their balance, as measured by the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), their ability to walk, assessed by the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), their capacity to perform activities of daily living, evaluated using the Barthel Index, and their overall quality of life specifically related to stroke recovery, as indicated by measures of stroke-specific quality of life. All of these secondary outcomes also achieved statistical significance, with p-values less than 0.05.

Furthermore, the study observed improvements in global cognitive function, as assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), within both treatment groups. However, there was no statistically significant difference observed in the magnitude of this cognitive improvement between the VR-robot group and the conventional rehabilitation alone group. The p-value for this comparison was 0.873, indicating no discernible distinction between the groups regarding cognitive gains.

An important aspect of the study's findings is the safety profile of the intervention. No adverse events were reported by any of the participants during the course of the trial. Based on these findings, the authors concluded that this combined approach of fully immersive virtual reality and lower-limb robotic rehabilitation is both feasible, meaning it can be practically implemented, and promising in its potential to aid stroke recovery. Nevertheless, the researchers strongly emphasized that further investigation is warranted. They recommended that larger-scale, longer-term clinical trials are necessary to definitively confirm the effectiveness of this intervention and to thoroughly assess its practicality in a broader clinical setting.
