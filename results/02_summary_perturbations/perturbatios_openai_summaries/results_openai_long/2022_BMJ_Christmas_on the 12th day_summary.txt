This article takes a lighthearted and humorous approach to discussing the persistent and, regrettably, often avoidable statistical and reporting issues that the esteemed statistical editors at The BMJ frequently encounter. These challenges become particularly pronounced during the exceptionally busy period of manuscript submissions leading up to Christmas, a time that seems to amplify these recurring problems.

To illustrate these common statistical and reporting shortcomings, the article cleverly adopts the structure of the popular Christmas carol, "The Twelve Days of Christmas." In this thematic presentation, each of the "twelve days" corresponds to one of twelve distinct and frequently observed problems that plague submitted research papers. The journey through these twelve days commences with a fundamental emphasis on the paramount importance of clearly and unequivocally defining the central research question that the study aims to answer. Crucially, this also extends to the precise definition of the "estimand," which refers to the specific quantity that the statistical analysis is intended to estimate.

Furthermore, the article strongly advocates for a shift in focus away from an exclusive reliance on simple P values, which can often be misleading. Instead, it champions the more informative and clinically meaningful reporting of effect estimates, which quantify the magnitude of an observed effect. Alongside these effect estimates, it underscores the critical need for the inclusion of confidence intervals. These intervals provide a range within which the true effect is likely to lie, offering a more nuanced understanding of the precision of the findings. The emphasis is squarely placed on understanding the *clinical relevance* of these results, rather than merely achieving statistical significance.

The article then delves into a number of frequent methodological pitfalls that authors often fall into. One significant issue highlighted is the incorrect or inadequate handling of missing data. This can severely compromise the validity of study results if not addressed appropriately. Another common misstep involves the practice of dichotomizing continuous variables. This means converting variables that naturally vary on a scale into just two categories, which can lead to a loss of valuable information and potentially introduce bias. The article also points out the erroneous assumption of linear relationships between variables when, in reality, these relationships might be non-linear, meaning they don't follow a straight line and require more complex modeling. Moreover, it cautions against making unsubstantiated and untested claims about differences observed within specific subgroups of the study population, which often lack the statistical power to support such definitive conclusions.

Further warnings are issued regarding other common statistical oversights. The article highlights the failure to adequately account for clustering in the data. Clustering occurs when observations are not independent but are grouped (e.g., patients within a hospital, repeated measurements on the same individual), and failing to account for this can lead to incorrect standard errors and P values. It also addresses the common misinterpretation of meta-analysis heterogeneity statistics, such as the I² statistic, which measures the degree of variation between studies. The article cautions against overusing meta-regression, a technique used to explore sources of heterogeneity, without proper justification or sufficient data. Finally, a significant concern raised is the inadequate evaluation of prediction models, particularly when it comes to assessing their calibration (how well the predicted probabilities match the observed outcomes) and the potential for overfitting (where a model performs well on the training data but poorly on new data).

In conclusion, the article strongly urges authors to adopt more rigorous statistical practices. This includes the essential step of checking underlying statistical assumptions, and where these assumptions are uncertain or violated, the use of sensitivity analyses is strongly recommended. Sensitivity analyses help to determine how robust the study
