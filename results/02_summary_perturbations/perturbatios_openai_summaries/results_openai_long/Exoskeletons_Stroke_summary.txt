This systematic review meticulously scrutinized a collection of research studies that were published within the timeframe spanning from the year 2010 up to and including the year 2017. The focus of this examination was specifically on interventions designed for post-stroke rehabilitation. The core principle investigated was the synergistic combination of assistive technological devices, namely exoskeleton or robotic devices, with immersive or interactive digital environments such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), or gamified experiences. The overarching objective of incorporating these advanced technologies was to facilitate enhancements in the motor function of individuals who have experienced a stroke and to promote their broader participation in daily life activities and rehabilitation processes.

In the execution of this comprehensive systematic review, the authors adhered to the established guidelines and protocols of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. This commitment to methodological rigor ensured that the literature search was conducted in a systematic and transparent manner. The database searches were performed across several prominent and reputable academic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, and the Cochrane Library. Through these extensive and carefully guided searches, a total of 30 individual studies were identified and subsequently included in the review. These 30 studies collectively involved approximately 385 participants, representing a diverse group of individuals undergoing post-stroke rehabilitation. The spectrum of study designs encompassed within this included sample was broad, ranging from highly rigorous randomized controlled trials, which provide strong evidence for causality, to more exploratory designs that may investigate novel approaches or preliminary findings.

Upon analyzing the characteristics of the included interventions, it became evident that the majority of these rehabilitation approaches were primarily directed towards the upper limb, with a significant majority of 28 out of the 30 studies focusing on this area of the body. Furthermore, the setting in which these interventions were predominantly implemented was the clinical environment, with 25 out of the 30 studies being conducted within healthcare facilities or rehabilitation centers. In terms of the interactive digital component, the interventions were fairly evenly distributed between those that utilized virtual reality (VR) based interfaces and those that employed game-based interfaces. Interestingly, during the course of this review, no studies were identified within the selected sample that specifically combined augmented reality (AR) with exoskeleton-based rehabilitation for stroke patients.

Across the diverse array of studies, which exhibited considerable heterogeneity in their methodologies and the outcome measures employed to assess progress, a consistent pattern of positive findings emerged. These outcome measures included various established assessments of motor function and impairment, such as the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (Fugl-Meyer), the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), and the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). Despite the variations, the review generally observed beneficial improvements in both motor function, referring to the ability to control and coordinate movements, and engagement, signifying the level of active participation and interest in the rehabilitation process, when virtual reality or game-based elements were integrated and paired with the use of exoskeleton therapy.

In their concluding remarks, the authors put forth the proposition that these innovative technological approaches, namely the combination of robotic/exoskeleton devices with VR, AR, or gamified elements, hold considerable promise. They suggest that these technologies possess the potential to effectively bridge the gap that often exists between inpatient or clinic-based rehabilitation and the continuation of recovery and maintenance of gains in the home environment. However, the authors also strongly emphasized a critical need for further research. Specifically, they highlighted
