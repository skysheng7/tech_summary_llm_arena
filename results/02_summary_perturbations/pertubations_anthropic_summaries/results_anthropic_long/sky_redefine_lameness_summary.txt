# Expanded Summary of "Redefining lameness assessment: Constructing lameness hierarchy using crowd-sourced data"

This research paper introduces and advocates for an innovative and entirely new approach to evaluating the condition of lameness in dairy cows. Instead of relying on the customary and established methods of gait scoring, which have historically involved assigning animals to a limited number of predefined categories, this study puts forth a completely different framework. This new framework is centered around the concept of building a "lameness hierarchy." This hierarchy is constructed through a process of direct, side-by-side, or "pairwise" comparisons between different cows. In essence, the cows are compared directly against each other, rather than being independently scored on a fixed scale.

The researchers conducted a thorough investigation comparing their novel method with the traditional approach. They observed that the conventional method of assigning lameness scores on a 5-level scale demonstrated a marked lack of consistency and reliability. Specifically, when measured using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), which is a statistical measure of agreement, the traditional 5-level gait scoring system yielded values ranging from a low of 0.44 to a high of 0.62. These figures indicate a rather weak level of agreement among those performing the assessments, meaning that different individuals or even the same individual at different times might assign significantly different scores to the same cow.

In stark contrast to the shortcomings of the traditional method, the newly proposed pairwise assessment method demonstrated a significantly superior level of reliability. When this new method was utilized by experienced and trained experts, the inter-observer reliability, meaning the agreement between different experts, was found to be exceptionally high. The ICC values for the pairwise assessment method among experts reached an impressive 0.81, signifying a very strong consensus and dependable assessment.

Furthermore, a crucial aspect of this study was to investigate the practicality and effectiveness of this pairwise assessment method when applied by individuals who were not necessarily trained experts in lameness assessment. The researchers explored the possibility of using "untrained crowd workers." They specifically utilized individuals from the online platform Amazon Mechanical Turk, a well-known crowdsourcing service. The results were highly encouraging, demonstrating that this method was indeed feasible for these untrained individuals. Remarkably, the agreement between the assessments performed by these crowd workers and those made by the trained experts was found to be very strong. This agreement was quantified by an ICC of 0.85, which is a testament to the intuitive and robust nature of the pairwise comparison approach.

An important finding related to efficiency was also achieved. Through the application of a sophisticated "subsampling algorithm," the researchers were able to determine the minimum number of assessments required to achieve a reliable outcome. They concluded that it was sufficient to have just 8 crowd workers evaluate each individual video pair (i.e., each comparison between two cows). Additionally, they calculated that only approximately 37% of all the theoretically possible pairwise comparisons needed to be made in order to successfully construct a dependable lameness hierarchy. This means that not every cow had to be compared to every other cow.

In conclusion, this innovative approach, which leverages pairwise comparisons and crowd-sourced data, offers a substantial improvement over existing lameness assessment techniques. It provides a method that is not only more reliable and consistent in its evaluations but also offers a finer
