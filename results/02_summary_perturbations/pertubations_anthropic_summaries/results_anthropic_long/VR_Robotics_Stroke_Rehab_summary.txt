# Expanded Summary of the Study

This pilot randomized controlled trial was designed with the specific intention of evaluating the effectiveness of a novel approach to lower limb rehabilitation for individuals who have experienced a stroke and are consequently suffering from hemiplegia. Specifically, the study focused on the efficacy of virtual reality (VR)-based robotic training. The participants in this investigation were a cohort of 42 individuals who had been diagnosed with stroke-induced hemiplegia and were residing in Shanghai, China.

The participants were strategically divided into two distinct groups for the purposes of comparison. One group, designated as the intervention group, comprised 20 individuals. This intervention group underwent a specific training regimen that involved the aforementioned VR-based robotic training in conjunction with their conventional rehabilitation therapies. This combined approach was administered for a duration of 30 minutes each day, and this schedule was maintained for five days of the week, over a period of four weeks. The second group, which served as the control group, also consisted of 20 individuals. These participants did not receive the VR-based robotic training; instead, they continued to receive only their standard, conventional rehabilitation therapies.

The findings that emerged from this comparative study were quite noteworthy. The data indicated that the intervention group, the one that received the VR-based robotic training in addition to conventional rehabilitation, demonstrated significantly greater improvements in a variety of crucial functional areas when contrasted with the control group. These improvements were most prominently observed in their lower limb motor function, with the intervention group showing a mean difference of 6.5 points in improvement, compared to the 3.3 points observed in the control group. Beyond motor function, the intervention group also exhibited more substantial gains in their balance capabilities, their overall walking ability, their capacity to perform daily living activities, and their self-reported quality of life.

However, it is important to note that while these functional improvements were evident, the study did not detect any significant differences in the improvements of cognitive function between the two groups; the progress in cognitive function was found to be similar across both the intervention and control groups.

Furthermore, a key aspect of this pilot study was the assessment of safety. Throughout the entire duration of the trial, no adverse events or untoward incidents were reported by any of the participants, regardless of which group they belonged to. This absence of negative outcomes strongly suggests that the VR-based robotic training approach is both safe and feasible to implement in the context of stroke rehabilitation.

In conclusion, this study, by virtue of its pilot nature, provides preliminary evidence that strongly supports the concept of VR-based robotic training as a potentially beneficial adjunct therapy for individuals undergoing rehabilitation after a stroke. The results are encouraging and suggest that this approach holds promise. Nevertheless, to definitively confirm these initial findings and to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the long-term effects and optimal application of this therapy, it is essential that future research endeavors involve larger participant cohorts and incorporate longer follow-up periods to observe sustained benefits.
