This research presented an innovative approach to evaluating lameness in dairy cattle, a critical issue for animal welfare and farm productivity. The developed methodology relied on a technique involving crowdsourced comparative assessments. In this system, individuals who were enlisted through the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform were presented with pairs of video clips. These videos depicted dairy cows in the process of walking, and the task for these recruited workers was to carefully observe and then indicate which of the two cows shown in each pair appeared to be exhibiting a greater degree of lameness.

To implement this assessment strategy, the researchers meticulously designed a total of eleven distinct tasks. Each of these tasks was comprised of ten separate pairings of video clips. For every single task that was created, a considerable number of workers were recruited, with fifty individuals participating in each task. In order to validate the accuracy and reliability of the crowdsourced assessments, these responses were then systematically compared against the judgments made by a panel of five seasoned experts who possessed extensive experience in assessing cattle lameness.

The outcomes derived from this comparison revealed a significant level of agreement among the collective responses of the crowd workers. Specifically, the agreement among these workers, as measured by the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), ranged from moderate (0.46) to high (0.77). In stark contrast, the agreement observed among the experienced cattle lameness assessors was exceptionally high, reaching an excellent level with an ICC of 0.87. Furthermore, when the average responses provided by the crowd workers were aggregated, they demonstrated an excellent degree of concordance with the assessments made by the experienced assessors, with ICC values falling between 0.89 and 0.91.

A particularly noteworthy finding of this study was the determination that a surprisingly small number of workers could still yield dependable results that closely mirrored those of the experts. The research indicated that as few as ten workers per task were sufficient to achieve reliable outcomes, characterized by a high level of agreement with the expert assessments (with ICC values exceeding 0.80). This insight underscores the efficiency and effectiveness of the crowdsourcing model.

In conclusion, the methodology put forth in this study offers a demonstrably swift and economically efficient means of assessing lameness in dairy cattle within commercial farming operations. This approach not only facilitates a rapid evaluation but also simultaneously enables the collection of extensive datasets. Such large-scale data is indispensable for the subsequent training of sophisticated computer vision algorithms, which are crucial for the development of automated systems designed to detect lameness in cattle with high accuracy.
