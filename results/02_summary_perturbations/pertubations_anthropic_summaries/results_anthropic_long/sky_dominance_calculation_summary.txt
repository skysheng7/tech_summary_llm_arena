Here's a rewritten and expanded summary, restating ideas and adding redundant explanations without introducing new facts:

This extensive investigation delved deeply into the dynamics of how established social rankings, specifically in the form of dominance hierarchies within a herd of dairy cows, undergo transformations. The central focus of this particular research endeavor was to meticulously examine the alterations observed in these dominance hierarchies. This examination was conducted under conditions where the level of competition present at the designated feeding areas was intentionally varied. To quantify this competition, a specific metric was employed: the measurement of feeder occupancy. The study meticulously collected data over an extended timeframe of ten months, involving a substantial cohort of 159 individual dairy cows, in order to capture these shifts over time.

The most prominent and significant outcomes that emerged from this thorough examination revealed a clear and quantifiable relationship. Specifically, it was observed that as the degree of feeder occupancy experienced an ascent, which serves as a direct indicator of heightened competition among the animals for access to food, the structure of the dominance hierarchy tended to become less sharply defined. In simpler terms, the hierarchy became flatter. To provide a precise measure of this phenomenon, the study determined that for every single percentage point increase in feeder occupancy, which signifies an escalation in the competitive environment, the steepness of the hierarchy experienced a reduction. This reduction in hierarchy steepness was quantified at a rate of 2.41 × 10⁻³ units.

Furthermore, beyond the overall structure of the hierarchy, the study also pinpointed specific behavioral adjustments that occurred in response to these increased competitive pressures. During periods characterized by high competition, it was noted that there was a discernible increase in the occurrence of what are termed "two-way dyads." These are specific instances where both animals involved in a dyadic interaction would, in effect, replace each other in subsequent interactions. The data indicated a 0.13% rise in these two-way dyads for every incremental 1% surge in feeder occupancy. Complementing this, the research also highlighted that a greater proportion of these interaction pairs exhibited a pattern where individuals who were previously considered dominant, in less competitive times, actually lost a proportionally larger share of their interactions, suggesting a shift in the balance of power.

When interpreting these observed phenomena, the authors of the study put forth a compelling explanation. Their central hypothesis is that during instances of intensified competition, the cows' innate and deeply ingrained high valuation of obtaining fresh feed, a crucial resource, possesses the capacity to effectively override their inherent dominance-related attributes. This overriding effect, they propose, can lead to subordinate animals becoming more empowered and consequently more successful in actively challenging those individuals who are typically in positions of dominance within the social structure.

Based on the comprehensive findings and the nuanced interpretation of the observed behaviors, the researchers put forth important practical advice and recommendations. They strongly advise against the common practice of calculating dominance hierarchies based exclusively on observations of agonistic interactions, which are typically aggressive or confrontational behaviors, particularly when these observations are made during periods of elevated competition. Instead, they emphatically underscore the critical importance of diligently considering the prevailing contextual factors, such as the level of competition for resources, when undertaking the task of constructing or interpreting dominance hierarchies among these animals, ensuring a more accurate and meaningful understanding of their social dynamics.
