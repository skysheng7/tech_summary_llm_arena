Here's a longer, more redundant summary based on your provided text, without introducing new facts:

This comprehensive systematic review delves into the utilization of advanced technological tools, specifically exoskeletons, when integrated with immersive virtual reality (VR), interactive augmented reality (AR), or engaging gamification strategies, for the purpose of rehabilitating individuals who have experienced a stroke. The authors meticulously sifted through a substantial body of research, ultimately examining a total of 30 distinct studies. These studies were published within a specific timeframe, ranging from the year 2010 up to and including 2017. In terms of participant numbers, these 30 studies collectively involved approximately 385 individuals who were undergoing rehabilitation.

Upon conducting their detailed analysis, the review team observed a pronounced and significant focus on a particular aspect of stroke recovery. It was found that the vast majority of the studies that were scrutinized, specifically 28 out of the total 30 studies, directed their attention and efforts towards the rehabilitation of the upper limbs of stroke patients. This was in contrast to a lesser emphasis placed on the rehabilitation of the lower limbs. Furthermore, the review identified several specific exoskeleton devices that were particularly popular and frequently employed across these studies. The most commonly utilized exoskeleton devices included the ARMin system, the Bi-Manu Track, and the ArmeoSpring. In parallel, the review also categorized the interactive technologies used, noting that exactly half of the studies, which equates to 15 of the 30 studies, incorporated virtual reality (VR) as their primary interactive method. The remaining 15 studies, making up the other half, opted to employ gamification approaches, leveraging game-like elements to enhance the rehabilitation experience.

The findings emerging from the collective results of these studies provided encouraging insights into the efficacy of these innovative interfacing techniques. Specifically, the results indicated a general trend of positive improvements in motor function among the stroke patients who participated in these novel rehabilitation programs. Not only did patients demonstrate enhanced physical recovery, but they also exhibited a notable increase in their levels of motivation and engagement when compared to the more conventional and traditional methods of rehabilitation that have been historically employed. This enhanced motivation and engagement are key factors in successful recovery.

A crucial and rather significant deficiency was identified within the landscape of stroke rehabilitation, particularly concerning the transition of therapy from controlled clinical environments to the more accessible setting of a patient's own home. The data revealed that a substantial proportion of the research, precisely 25 out of the 30 studies, were exclusively conducted within clinical settings. In stark contrast, a considerably smaller number of studies, only 4 in total, explored or were conducted in home-based environments. This stark imbalance undeniably highlights an urgent and pressing need for the development and implementation of more accessible and practical rehabilitation solutions that can be effectively utilized by patients in their own homes.

In the course of their thorough investigation, the review authors made an important observation regarding the application of a specific technology within their gathered sample of studies. They found that there were absolutely no augmented reality (AR)-based systems that were included or represented within the scope of their sampled research. Consequently, the review concludes with a clear call to action for future research endeavors. These future studies are strongly encouraged to focus on the creation of highly customizable games that are specifically designed to sustain and foster patient motivation over time. Additionally, it is imperative to explore a wider array of interfacing technologies beyond those already
