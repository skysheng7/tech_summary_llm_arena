# Extended Summary of "Verifiable Quantum Advantage without Structure"

This research paper, authored by Yamakawa and Zhandry, presents a significant breakthrough in the realm of quantum computation. It achieves the demonstration of unconditional quantum advantages, meaning advantages that are guaranteed and not dependent on any unproven assumptions, by utilizing the concept of random oracles. A crucial aspect of this work is that it bypasses the necessity for the highly structured oracles that were a prerequisite in prior investigations, and it also avoids the reliance on strong cryptographic assumptions that were previously considered essential. The core of their findings revolves around several key areas:

First, regarding **NP Search Problems**, the researchers have successfully engineered specific NP search problems. These problems are designed such that quantum computers can solve them with remarkable efficiency, meaning in a significantly reduced number of computational steps, whereas classical computers, by their very nature, are fundamentally incapable of solving them efficiently in comparison, even when measured relative to the context of a random oracle. This highlights a distinct computational superiority of quantum systems for certain types of problems.

Second, in the domain of **Cryptographic Separations**, the paper introduces a class of functions that serve as instructive counterexamples for various fundamental cryptographic primitives. Specifically, they demonstrate functions that are demonstrably one-way against adversaries operating with classical computational power, meaning it's computationally infeasible for them to reverse the function to find the input given the output. Similarly, these functions are also shown to be collision-resistant against such classical adversaries, implying that finding two different inputs that produce the same output is extremely difficult classically. However, these same functions are shown to be easily "broken" or defeated by quantum computers, revealing a clear vulnerability of classical cryptographic assumptions when faced with quantum capabilities.

Third, concerning **Proofs of Quantumness**, the paper provides a method for constructing proofs that unequivocally demonstrate the use of quantum computation. These proofs are not only unconditional in their validity but also publicly verifiable, meaning anyone can independently check their correctness without needing special access or trust. A particularly noteworthy achievement is that these proofs require a minimal amount of interaction between the prover and the verifier. For adversaries who adhere to a uniform distribution of computations, the proofs are non-interactive, requiring no back-and-forth communication. For adversaries who do not follow a uniform distribution (non-uniform adversaries), only a two-message interaction is needed, which is still a very low level of communication.

Fourth, in the area of **Certifiable Randomness**, the paper outlines protocols that allow for the generation of randomness that can be reliably certified. This means that the generated randomness is not only truly random but also provably so, with the certification process itself being secure and verifiable. The construction of these protocols is contingent upon the assumption of the Aaronson-Ambainis conjecture, a well-regarded conjecture in quantum computation theory. Importantly, these certifiable randomness protocols achieve this goal with a minimal number of interaction rounds, making them highly efficient in practice.

Finally, the **Technical Approach** underpinning these groundbreaking results is based on the ingenious use of folded Reed-Solomon codes. These codes possess a specific and highly desirable property known as list-recoverability. This property is crucial because it enables quantum algorithms to efficiently locate preimages – the original inputs to a function or code that result in a given output or codeword
