# Extended Summary of "Digital Health Technology for Stroke Rehabilitation in Canada: A Scoping Review"

This comprehensive scoping review was undertaken with the specific objective of thoroughly investigating and documenting the ways in which Digital Health Technologies, commonly referred to as DHTs, have been implemented and utilized within the context of stroke rehabilitation programs and initiatives that are taking place throughout Canada. In order to achieve this objective, the researchers meticulously analyzed a collection of fourteen distinct research studies. These particular studies were carefully selected for their relevance and scope, and they had all been published within a defined timeframe, spanning from the year 2010 up to and including the year 2022.

The extensive analysis of these fourteen studies yielded a clear and predominant trend: the overwhelming majority of the research efforts that were examined concentrated their attention on the rehabilitation of the upper extremities of stroke survivors. To be precise, a substantial 85.71% of the studies specifically addressed interventions and technologies aimed at improving function in the arms and hands. Furthermore, it was observed that the primary focus of these technological interventions was directed towards individuals in the chronic phase of their stroke recovery. This particular phase accounted for a significant proportion of the studies, representing 64.3% of the total. The research also indicated a strong preference for utilizing these digital health technologies within the familiar and convenient environment of the patient's own home, with approximately 50% of the studies being conducted in this setting.

The types of Digital Health Technologies that were most frequently employed and reported upon in these studies encompassed a diverse array of innovative tools. These included, but were not limited to, sophisticated sensor-based systems designed to track movement and provide feedback, immersive virtual reality environments that simulate therapeutic activities, engaging gaming systems that gamify rehabilitation exercises, comprehensive telerehabilitation platforms that facilitate remote care and monitoring, and advanced robotic devices that assist with precise and repetitive movements.

Crucially, the findings stemming from these studies provided compelling evidence that these digital health technologies are not only feasible for widespread implementation but are also demonstrably effective. The research consistently showed that these technologies were capable of bringing about significant improvements in several key areas. Specifically, they were found to be effective in enhancing motor function, which refers to the ability to move the body with control and coordination. They also played a significant role in boosting patient engagement, meaning that individuals were more actively and enthusiastically involved in their rehabilitation process. Furthermore, these technologies contributed positively to the overall quality of life experienced by stroke survivors.

The researchers also delved into the factors that either facilitated or hindered the successful adoption and application of these DHTs. They identified several key facilitators, which are elements that actively promote and support the use of these technologies. Prominent among these were high levels of user motivation, signifying the intrinsic drive of the patient to engage in their recovery; strong clinician support, indicating the crucial role of healthcare professionals in guiding and encouraging the use of technology; and the overall performance of the technology itself, implying that the devices and software need to be reliable and user-friendly. Conversely, several barriers were also identified, representing obstacles that impede the effective use of these technologies. These included various technical challenges, such as connectivity issues or software glitches; user inexperience with digital devices, which can lead to frustration and difficulty in operation; and limitations in device portability, making
