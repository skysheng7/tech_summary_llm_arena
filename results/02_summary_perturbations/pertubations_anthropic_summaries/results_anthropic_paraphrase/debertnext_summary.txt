The DeBERTNeXT framework, detailed in this paper, is a novel approach to detecting fake news by integrating both text and image data from news articles. It leverages **DeBERTa V3** for textual analysis and **ConvNeXT** for visual analysis. The combined outputs from these components are then used for a binary classification task, determining whether news is genuine or fabricated.

Evaluated across three datasets—Fakeddit (154,644 entries), Politifact (304 entries), and Gossipcop (8,008 entries)—the framework achieved **state-of-the-art performance**. Specifically, DeBERTNeXT surpassed current models with improvements of **3.80% on Fakeddit**, reaching **91.2% accuracy**, **2.10% on Politifact**, with **91.3% accuracy**, and **1.00% on Gossipcop**, achieving **90.2% accuracy**.

A significant improvement over prior methods stems from its utilization of cutting-edge architectures, specifically DeBERTa and ConvNeXT, in contrast to frequently employed models like BERT/XLNet and VGG-19. This allows for superior feature extraction from both data types without the need for specialized preprocessing or reliance on event-specific dependencies.

A multimodal fake news detection system named **DeBERTNeXT** is presented in this paper, which analyzes both the textual and visual content of news articles. The system employs **DeBERTa V3** for text processing and **ConvNeXT** for image processing. These outputs are then merged and fed into a binary classifier to distinguish between real and fake news.

The efficacy of DeBERTNeXT was demonstrated on three datasets: Fakeddit, comprising 154,644 records, Politifact, with 304 records, and Gossipcop, containing 8,008 records. The framework achieved **state-of-the-art results** on these datasets. It outperformed existing models by **3.80% on Fakeddit** (achieving 91.2% accuracy), **2.10% on Politifact** (with 91.3% accuracy), and **1.00% on Gossipcop** (reaching 90.2% accuracy).

The primary advantage of DeBERTNeXT over preceding approaches lies in its adoption of more advanced architectures, namely DeBERTa and ConvNeXT, compared to commonly used models such as BERT/XLNet and VGG-19. This enables more effective feature extraction from both modalities, eliminating the requirement for domain-specific preprocessing or event-based dependencies.

**Paraphrase 3:**

This paper introduces **DeBERTNeXT**, a framework designed for multimodal fake news detection that integrates textual and visual information from news articles. The model utilizes **DeBERTa V3** to process text and **ConvNeXT** to process images. The outputs from these two components are then concatenated for the purpose of binary classification, categorizing news as either real or fake.

The framework underwent testing on three distinct datasets: Fakeddit (154,644 records), Politifact (
