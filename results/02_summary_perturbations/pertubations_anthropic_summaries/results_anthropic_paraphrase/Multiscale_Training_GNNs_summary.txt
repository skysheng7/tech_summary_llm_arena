This research presents multiscale training strategies designed to enhance the computational efficiency of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) without compromising, and potentially even boosting, their performance. The researchers outline three primary techniques: a **Coarse-to-Fine** method involving training on graphs that are gradually condensed, a **Sub-to-Full** approach where training begins with smaller graph segments that expand over time, and **Multiscale Gradients Computation**, which approximates high-resolution gradients by leveraging multiple levels of detail. The central idea is that GNN weight matrices are not dependent on the graph's size, enabling substantial reductions in computational expenses by training on smaller graphs with fewer nodes and edges. Empirical evaluations conducted on diverse datasets (including OGBN-Arxiv, OGBN-MAG, ShapeNet, and PPI) and various architectures (such as GCN, GIN, and GAT) show that these techniques deliver accuracy equivalent to or better than conventional training, while simultaneously cutting down FLOPs and training duration by as much as 80%. This framework is versatile, adaptable to different GNN architectures, pooling methodologies, and both transductive and inductive learning scenarios.

To enhance the computational efficiency of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) while preserving or improving their performance, this paper introduces multiscale training methodologies. The authors detail three principal strategies: **Coarse-to-Fine** training, which involves working with progressively smaller pooled graphs; **Sub-to-Full** training, where training commences on expanding subgraphs; and **Multiscale Gradients Computation**, a method for approximating fine-scale gradients by utilizing multiple resolution levels. The core principle is that GNN weight matrices are size-agnostic, allowing for significant reductions in computational demands through training on simplified graphs with fewer nodes and edges. Extensive experiments across various datasets (e.g., OGBN-Arxiv, OGBN-MAG, ShapeNet, PPI) and architectures (like GCN, GIN, GAT) confirm that these methods achieve comparable or superior accuracy to standard training, reducing FLOPs and training time by up to 80%. This versatile approach is compatible with a range of GNN architectures, pooling strategies, and both transductive and inductive learning tasks.

The paper "Towards Efficient Training of Graph Neural Networks: A Multiscale Approach" proposes multiscale training techniques to boost the computational efficiency of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), with the aim of maintaining or enhancing their performance. The presented methods include three core strategies: **Coarse-to-Fine**, which entails training on graphs that are progressively downsampled; **Sub-to-Full**, where training starts with smaller graph portions and gradually expands; and **Multiscale Gradients Computation**, which approximates fine-grained gradients using information from multiple resolution levels. The fundamental observation is that GNN weight matrices are invariant to graph size, permitting a considerable decrease in computational cost by training on reduced graphs with fewer nodes and edges. Through experiments on multiple datasets (such as OGBN-Arxiv, OGBN-MAG, ShapeNet, and PPI) and architectures (including GCN, GIN, and GAT), these methods have demonstrated the ability to
