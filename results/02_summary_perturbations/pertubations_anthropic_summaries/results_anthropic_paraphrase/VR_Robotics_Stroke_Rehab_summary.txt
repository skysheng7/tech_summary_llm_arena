Here are several paraphrased versions of the summary, using different wording and sentence structures while retaining all original information:

**Paraphrase 1:**

A preliminary randomized controlled trial was conducted in Shanghai, China, to assess the efficacy of virtual reality (VR)-enabled robotic training for lower limb recovery in 42 stroke survivors experiencing hemiplegia. Participants were allocated to either an intervention group (20 individuals) receiving VR-based robotic training alongside standard rehabilitation for 30 minutes each day, five days weekly over four weeks, or a control group (20 individuals) who underwent only conventional rehabilitation. Findings indicated that the intervention group demonstrated substantially enhanced outcomes in lower limb motor function (with a mean difference of 6.5 compared to 3.3 in the control group), balance, gait, daily living activities, and overall quality of life. Improvements in cognitive function did not differ between the groups. The trial experienced no adverse events, suggesting the safety and practicality of this method. This research offers initial support for VR-based robotic training as a potentially beneficial supplementary therapy for stroke recovery, but larger investigations with extended observation periods are necessary to validate these results.

**Paraphrase 2:**

In Shanghai, China, a pilot randomized controlled trial involved 42 stroke patients with hemiplegia to investigate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR)-enhanced robotic training for their lower limbs. Over a four-week period, the intervention group (20 participants) engaged in VR-based robotic training combined with conventional rehabilitation for 30 minutes daily, five days a week. In contrast, the control group (20 participants) received only conventional rehabilitation. The study revealed that the intervention group experienced significantly greater gains in motor function of the lower limbs (mean difference 6.5 versus 3.3), as well as improvements in balance, walking capacity, participation in daily activities, and quality of life, when compared to the control group. Cognitive function improvements were comparable across both groups. The absence of any adverse events during the trial highlights the safety and feasibility of this therapeutic approach. This study lays the groundwork by providing preliminary evidence that VR-based robotic training could be a valuable addition to stroke rehabilitation, though further extensive studies with longer follow-up durations are required for confirmation.

**Paraphrase 3:**

The effectiveness of virtual reality (VR)-driven robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation was examined in a pilot randomized controlled trial involving 42 hemiplegic stroke patients in Shanghai, China. For four weeks, the intervention group of 20 participants received 30 minutes of daily VR-based robotic training alongside conventional rehabilitation, five days a week. The control group, also consisting of 20 participants, was limited to conventional rehabilitation alone. The results showed that the intervention group achieved considerably better improvements in lower limb motor function (6.5 average difference versus 3.3), balance, walking ability, daily living skills, and quality of life than the control group. Cognitive function improvements were similar between the two groups. The trial proceeded without any adverse events, underscoring the safety and feasibility of this method. The study offers initial evidence suggesting that VR-based robotic training holds promise as an adjunctive therapy for stroke patients, but its findings necessitate validation through larger trials with extended follow-up periods.
