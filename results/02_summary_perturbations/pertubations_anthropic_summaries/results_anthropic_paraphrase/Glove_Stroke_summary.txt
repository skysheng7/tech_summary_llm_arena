This systematic review delves into the rehabilitative benefits of robotic gloves worn on the hand for enhancing motor skills in individuals who have experienced a stroke. A comprehensive search of five databases up to September 2021 yielded a limited selection of 5 studies that satisfied the review's inclusion requirements. The principal discoveries indicated that every examined study reported beneficial therapeutic outcomes. However, these studies were marked by considerable drawbacks, such as minimal participant numbers (ranging from 3 to 13 individuals), an absence of randomized controlled trials, an exclusive focus on stroke survivors in the chronic phase with slight to moderate muscle stiffness, and research quality ratings between 7 and 10 out of a possible 12 points. The review details five distinct robotic glove technologies (EPHO, PneuGlove, X-Glove, HiM system, and IronHand system) that were employed in rehabilitation programs lasting between 4 and 6 weeks. The researchers' final assessment suggests that while the initial findings are encouraging, further in-depth research is imperative. Such studies should feature larger participant groups, superior methodological rigor, uniform treatment approaches, and comparative analyses against traditional rehabilitation methods to definitively establish the therapeutic efficacy of wearable robotic gloves in aiding stroke recovery.
