A novel approach for evaluating lameness in dairy cows was established through the use of crowdsourced comparative judgments. This method involved enlisting individuals through Amazon Mechanical Turk to observe synchronized video clips of cows in motion and subsequently indicate which animal exhibited more severe lameness. The investigation comprised 11 distinct tasks, each containing 10 pairs of video footage, and engaged 50 participants for every task. Their collected data was then juxtaposed with the assessments of 11 seasoned experts in cattle lameness. The findings revealed a moderate to strong consensus among the crowd workers (Intraclass Correlation Coefficients ranging from 0.46 to 0.77) and a superior agreement level among the experienced assessors (ICC = 0.87). Furthermore, the aggregated responses from the crowd workers demonstrated an excellent correlation with the judgments of the experienced assessors (ICC = 0.89-0.91). The research determined that a mere 10 workers per task sufficed to obtain dependable outcomes with a high degree of concordance to expert opinions (ICC exceeding 0.80). This technique offers a rapid and economical means for evaluating lameness within commercial herds, facilitating the acquisition of extensive data vital for training computer vision models designed for automated lameness detection.
