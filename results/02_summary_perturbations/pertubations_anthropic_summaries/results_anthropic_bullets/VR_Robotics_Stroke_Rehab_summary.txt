Here is the summary converted into bullet points, preserving all information:

*   **Study Type:** Pilot randomized controlled trial.
*   **Objective:** To evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR)-based robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation.
*   **Participants:** 42 stroke patients with hemiplegia.
*   **Location:** Shanghai, China.
*   **Intervention Group (n=20):** Received VR-based robotic training plus conventional rehabilitation.
    *   **Duration:** 30 minutes daily, 5 days/week for 4 weeks.
*   **Control Group (n=20):** Received only conventional rehabilitation.
*   **Results - Intervention Group vs. Control Group:**
    *   Significantly greater improvements in lower limb motor function (mean difference 6.5 vs 3.3).
    *   Greater improvements in balance.
    *   Greater improvements in walking ability.
    *   Greater improvements in activities of daily living.
    *   Greater improvements in quality of life.
*   **Cognitive Function:** Improvements were similar between groups.
*   **Safety:** No adverse events occurred during the trial.
*   **Feasibility:** Demonstrated the safety and feasibility of the VR-based robotic training approach.
*   **Conclusion:** Provides preliminary evidence supporting VR-based robotic training as a promising adjunct therapy for stroke rehabilitation.
*   **Future Research:** Larger studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm these findings.
