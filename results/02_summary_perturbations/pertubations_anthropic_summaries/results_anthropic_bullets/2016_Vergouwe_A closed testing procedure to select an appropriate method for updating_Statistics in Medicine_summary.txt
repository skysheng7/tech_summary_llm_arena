Here's the summary converted into bullet points:

*   The article proposes a closed testing procedure to systematically select the best method for updating clinical prediction models when applying them to new populations.
*   Three update methods of increasing complexity are described:
    *   Recalibration in the large (updating intercept only)
    *   Recalibration (updating intercept and slope)
    *   Model revision (re-estimating all coefficients)
*   The closed testing procedure uses sequential likelihood ratio tests while maintaining the Type I error rate.
*   It prevents overfitting in small samples by selecting simpler methods unless strong evidence supports more complex updates.
*   Three clinical examples (prostate cancer screening, traumatic brain injury, and pediatric fever) demonstrate the procedure's effectiveness.
*   In these examples, the procedure selects parsimonious methods in smaller samples and prevents overfitting compared to automatic model revision.
*   Simulation studies confirm that the procedure maintains acceptable Type I error rates.
    *   These rates are slightly above 0.05 for small samples and converge to 0.05 with larger samples.
*   Simulation studies also show that the procedure produces lower mean squared error in coefficient estimation compared to full model revision.
