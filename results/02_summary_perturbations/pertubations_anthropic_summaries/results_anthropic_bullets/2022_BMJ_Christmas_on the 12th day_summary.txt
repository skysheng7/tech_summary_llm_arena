*   The BMJ article "On the 12th Day of Christmas, a Statistician Sent to Me..." presents 12 common statistical errors encountered by The BMJ's statistical editors during peer review.
*   The errors are framed as a Christmas-themed guide for researchers.
*   The 12 key recommendations are:
    *   Clarify research questions and estimands.
    *   Focus on estimates and confidence intervals rather than just p-values.
    *   Properly account for missing data.
    *   Avoid dichotomizing continuous variables.
    *   Consider non-linear relationships.
    *   Quantify differences in subgroup results.
    *   Account for data clustering.
    *   Interpret I² and meta-regression appropriately.
    *   Assess calibration in prediction models.
    *   Carefully consider variable selection approaches.
    *   Assess the impact of statistical assumptions.
    *   Use reporting guidelines and avoid overinterpretation.
*   The authors emphasize that statistical significance does not equal clinical significance.
*   They also stress that "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."
*   The importance of complete reporting using established guidelines like CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA, and TRIPOD is highlighted.
*   The article's aim is to help researchers avoid common pitfalls.
*   It also aims to reduce the burden on statistical reviewers during the Christmas period when submission volumes surge.
