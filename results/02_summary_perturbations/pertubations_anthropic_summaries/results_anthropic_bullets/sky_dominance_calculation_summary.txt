Here's the summary converted into bullet points:

*   **Research Objective**: The study investigated how dominance hierarchies in dairy cows change with varying levels of competition at feeding areas, measured by feeder occupancy, over a 10-month period with 159 cows.

*   **Key Findings**:
    *   As feeder occupancy increased (indicating higher competition), the dominance hierarchy became flatter.
    *   Hierarchy steepness decreased by 2.41 × 10⁻³ for each 1% rise in feeder occupancy.

*   **Behavioral Changes**:
    *   During high competition, there was a 0.13% increase in two-way dyads (where both cows replaced each other) per 1% feeder occupancy increase.
    *   7.57% more dyads showed previously dominant individuals losing proportionally more interactions.

*   **Interpretation**: The authors suggest that during heightened competition, cows' high valuation of fresh feed can override intrinsic dominance attributes, leading subordinate animals to be more successful in challenging dominant individuals.

*   **Recommendations**:
    *   Researchers advise against calculating dominance hierarchies based solely on agonistic interactions during high competition periods.
    *   The importance of considering context when constructing dominance hierarchies is emphasized.
