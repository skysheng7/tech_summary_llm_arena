Here's the summary converted into bullet points:

*   This systematic review examines the therapeutic effects of wearable robotic gloves on hand function improvement in stroke patients.
*   The authors searched five databases through September 2021.
*   Only 5 studies met the inclusion criteria.
*   All identified studies showed positive therapeutic effects.
*   Studies had significant limitations:
    *   Small sample sizes (3-13 participants).
    *   Lack of randomized controlled trials.
    *   Focus primarily on chronic stroke patients with mild-moderate spasticity.
    *   Methodological quality scores ranged from 7-10 out of 12 points.
*   Five different robotic glove devices were used in the interventions:
    *   EPHO
    *   PneuGlove
    *   X-Glove
    *   HiM system
    *   IronHand system
*   Intervention durations lasted 4-6 weeks.
*   The authors conclude that more comprehensive studies are needed.
*   These studies should have:
    *   Larger sample sizes.
    *   Higher methodological quality.
    *   Standardized protocols.
    *   Comparison with conventional therapies.
*   These comprehensive studies are necessary to confirm the therapeutic effectiveness of wearable robotic gloves for stroke rehabilitation.
