# Summary of DeBERTNeXT Paper

The key advantage over previous approaches is the use of more advanced architectures (DeBERTa and ConvNeXT) compared to commonly used models like BERT/XLNet and VGG-19, enabling better feature extraction from both modalities without requiring domain-specific preprocessing or event-based dependencies. This paper introduces **DeBERTNeXT**, a multimodal fake news detection framework that combines textual and visual information from news articles. The model uses **DeBERTa V3** for processing text and **ConvNeXT** for processing images, with their outputs concatenated for binary classification of news as real or fake. The framework was tested on three datasets: Fakeddit (154,644 records), Politifact (304 records), and Gossipcop (8,008 records), achieving state-of-the-art results. DeBERTNeXT outperformed existing models by **3.80% on Fakeddit** (91.2% accuracy), **2.10% on Politifact** (91.3% accuracy), and **1.00% on Gossipcop** (90.2% accuracy).
