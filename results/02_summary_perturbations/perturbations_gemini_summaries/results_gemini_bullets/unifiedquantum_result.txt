Here are the bullet points from the summary:

*   Introduces new "no-go" theorems in quantum mechanics.
*   These theorems unify existing principles such as no-cloning and no-deleting theorems.
*   Proposes a "no-encoding" theorem.
*   The "no-encoding" theorem states that it's impossible to linearly superpose an unknown pure state and a fixed state in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space using a universal quantum transformation.
*   Presents unified schemes for perfect and imperfect quantum tasks.
*   These tasks include cloning and deleting.
*   The quantum tasks are characterized by the linear independence of input states.
*   Develops new superposing schemes for unknown pure states in finite sets.
*   Develops new superposing schemes for cases where multiple copies of input states are available.
*   Aims to provide a deeper understanding of quantum transformations and their limitations.
*   This understanding is based on the superposition principle.
