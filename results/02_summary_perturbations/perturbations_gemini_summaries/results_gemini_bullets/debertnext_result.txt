Here is the summary converted into bullet points:

*   DeBERTNeXT is a multimodal framework designed for fake news detection.
*   It combines textual and visual information for its analysis.
*   The model employs pre-trained DeBERTa V3 for processing text.
*   It utilizes pre-trained ConvNeXt Large for processing images.
*   Features from both text and image models are concatenated.
*   The concatenated features are then fed into a classification layer.
*   Experiments were conducted on the Fakeddit, Politifact, and Gossipcop datasets.
*   DeBERTNeXT demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models.
*   Its improvements were observed in accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
*   The authors identified challenges associated with multimodal fusion.
*   They emphasized the necessity of efficient models to address the increasing amount of fake news.
*   Future research directions may include integrating additional modalities such as audio and video.
*   The goal of incorporating more modalities is to create a more comprehensive fake news detection system.
