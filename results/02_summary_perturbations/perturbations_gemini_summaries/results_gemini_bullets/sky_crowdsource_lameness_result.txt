Here's the summary converted into bullet points:

*   A crowdsourced method for assessing lameness in dairy cattle using short video clips was explored.
*   Non-experienced crowd workers were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk.
*   Crowd workers compared videos of cows walking side-by-side.
*   Crowd workers rated the relative lameness of the cows.
*   When responses were averaged, the crowdsourcing approach achieved high agreement with experienced assessors.
*   This suggests the method is reliable and cost-effective for assessing lameness.
*   As few as 10 crowd workers per task are sufficient to obtain reliable assessments.
*   The method has the potential to generate large datasets for training automated lameness detection algorithms.
*   The method could lead to earlier detection of lameness in commercial herds.
*   The method could lead to improved management of lameness in commercial herds.
