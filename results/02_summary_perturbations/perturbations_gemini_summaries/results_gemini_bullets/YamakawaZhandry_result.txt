Here's the summary converted into bullet points:

*   Presents new theoretical results demonstrating quantum advantage for problems that are not NP-complete, using a weaker assumption for quantum speedups.
*   Shows how random oracles can provide unconditional proofs of quantumness.
*   Constructs counterexamples of cryptographic primitives secure against classical algorithms but insecure against quantum ones.
*   Achieves these constructions using error-correcting codes and quantum Fourier transforms, with some results conditional on the Aaronson-Ambainis conjecture.
*   Instantiates these theoretical models with standard cryptographic hash functions like SHA2, suggesting practical implications for new cryptographic constructions.
*   Challenges the notion that significant "structure" is always required for quantum advantage.
*   Explores the separation between classical and quantum random oracle models.
