Here's the summary converted into bullet points:

*   This pilot study investigated the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR)-based robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation in stroke patients with hemiplegia.
*   The intervention group, which received VR-based robotic training alongside conventional rehabilitation, showed statistically significant improvements in lower limb motor function compared to the control group.
*   Participants in the intervention group also demonstrated enhanced balancing function.
*   Participants in the intervention group also demonstrated enhanced walking ability.
*   Participants in the intervention group also demonstrated enhanced activities of daily living.
*   Participants in the intervention group also demonstrated enhanced quality of life.
*   Global cognitive function did not show significant improvement between the groups.
*   The study concluded that VR-based robotic training is a promising approach for stroke rehabilitation.
*   The study concluded that VR-based robotic training is a feasible approach for stroke rehabilitation.
*   The study supports the need for larger-scale studies to validate its effectiveness.
