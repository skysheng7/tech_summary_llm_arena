Here's the summary converted into bullet points, preserving all information:

*   Generative AI models, specifically OpenAI's DALL-E 3, present a biased and romanticized view of livestock farming.
*   This bias erases the realities of intensive farming practices.
*   The study found that DALL-E 3 consistently generated pastoral images of cows grazing and pigs in mud.
*   This occurred even when explicitly asked for realistic depictions.
*   The bias is attributed to DALL-E 3's automatic prompt revision process.
*   Disabling prompt revision revealed that the base model could generate more accurate, indoor-focused images reflecting modern intensive farming.
*   This suggests the bias is introduced through the prompt revision mechanism.
*   The romanticized portrayal risks reinforcing misinformation about animal agriculture.
*   This hinders meaningful dialogue about animal welfare.
*   It also hinders dialogue about the social sustainability of farming.
*   Authors recommend AI transparency policies.
*   Authors recommend disclosure of prompt revision.
*   Authors recommend more representative image generation to address this issue.
