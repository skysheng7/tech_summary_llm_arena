This scoping review embarked on an in-depth exploration into the realm of how digital health technologies (DHTs) have been utilized for the purpose of stroke rehabilitation within the geographical confines of Canada. This comprehensive investigation spanned a significant period, specifically from the year 2010 all the way through to the year 2022, encompassing over a decade of research and development.

In the course of this systematic review, a total of fourteen distinct studies were brought to light, each contributing to our understanding of this evolving field. The vast majority of these identified studies, a notable proportion of the total, concentrated their investigative efforts on the functional recovery of the upper extremity, a critical area of concern following a stroke. Furthermore, the research predominantly centered on the chronic phase of stroke recovery, a period where sustained engagement in rehabilitation is crucial for optimizing long-term outcomes.

The technologies that emerged as most frequently employed within these studies were varied and representative of the advancements in digital health. These commonly included the immersive and interactive capabilities of virtual reality (VR) systems, the engaging and motivational aspects of gaming systems, and the flexible and accessible nature of mobile applications and sensor-based training interventions.

The principal conclusions drawn from the synthesis of these fourteen studies were indeed encouraging and pointed towards a positive outlook. The findings strongly suggest that the implementation of DHTs in stroke rehabilitation is not only feasible from a practical standpoint but also demonstrates a discernible effectiveness in improving the outcomes experienced by stroke survivors. This effectiveness translates into tangible enhancements in various aspects of recovery. Moreover, these digital tools hold considerable promise in their potential to surmount existing obstacles that often impede access to rehabilitation services. This is particularly relevant for individuals residing in more remote or rural regions of Canada, where traditional rehabilitation facilities may be scarce or difficult to reach.

However, despite these promising advancements and the clear potential benefits, the review also illuminated certain challenges that currently stand as impediments to the widespread and successful integration of DHTs into standard stroke rehabilitation practices across Canada. These challenges encompass a range of issues, including inherent technical limitations within the technologies themselves, a degree of user inexperience among some patients and potentially even some clinicians in navigating and utilizing these digital platforms, and a noticeable lack of consistent or robust clinician involvement in the design, implementation, and oversight of these DHT-based rehabilitation programs. These factors need to be proactively addressed and resolved to pave the way for broader adoption.

Looking ahead, the review proposed several key recommendations for future research endeavors within Canada pertaining to DHTs and stroke rehabilitation. It was strongly advocated that future research should place a paramount emphasis on conducting high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs), considered the gold standard for evaluating the efficacy of interventions. Additionally, it was recommended that the scope of outcome measures investigated should be broadened beyond just upper extremity function, encompassing a more holistic approach to recovery. Finally, there is a clear need to more thoroughly investigate the application and impact of DHTs during earlier phases of stroke recovery, as well as to ensure that the benefits and usability are considered and optimized for a diverse range of patient populations, acknowledging that stroke affects individuals from all walks of life.
