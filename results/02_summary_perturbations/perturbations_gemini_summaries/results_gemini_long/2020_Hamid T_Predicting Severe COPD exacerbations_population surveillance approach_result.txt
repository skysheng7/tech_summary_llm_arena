Here's a longer, more redundant explanation of the provided summary, without introducing any new information:

This particular investigation was focused on examining the ways in which administrative health data could be utilized, or rather employed, for the purpose of predicting, forecasting, and identifying instances of severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbations. In the course of this research, the individuals conducting the study went on to develop and subsequently evaluate a variety of different machine-learning algorithms, which are sophisticated computational models. Of all the algorithms that were put to the test, it was found that the gradient boosting method demonstrated the highest level of accuracy, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.82, when it came to predicting a patient's likelihood of being hospitalized within a two-month timeframe. It is important to note that this particular approach, the one that utilized administrative data, represented a significant improvement and proved to be considerably more effective than the currently employed standard of care. The current standard of care, it should be understood, is a method that exclusively depends on an individual's previous history of exacerbations, and nothing more. The conclusions drawn from this study strongly indicate, or suggest, that the utilization of administrative health data can indeed be a highly effective means of identifying those COPD patients who are at a greater risk of experiencing severe exacerbations. This identification, in turn, allows for the implementation of targeted and proactive preventive interventions. In essence, the research put forward a proposal, suggesting that this method of population surveillance, or monitoring of large groups of people, has the potential to lead to enhanced patient outcomes, meaning better health results for those affected by COPD, and furthermore, it could also potentially lead to a reduction in overall healthcare expenditures and costs.
