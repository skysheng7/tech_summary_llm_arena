This systematic review was undertaken with the express purpose of examining, in detail, the beneficial therapeutic impacts that can be achieved through the utilization of wearable robotic gloves, specifically in the context of enhancing the functional capabilities of the hands in individuals who have experienced a stroke. The initial phase of this comprehensive investigation involved a broad screening process, wherein a substantial number of articles were meticulously reviewed. Specifically, a total of 2,674 articles were initially screened to identify relevant research. However, after a rigorous application of predetermined inclusion criteria, it was found that a significantly smaller subset of these articles, comprising precisely 5 distinct studies, ultimately satisfied all the requisite conditions for inclusion in this review.

These selected studies, while exhibiting a moderate level of methodological quality in their design and execution, consistently arrived at a shared and important conclusion. The findings from these 5 studies collectively indicated that the application of wearable robotic gloves does indeed exert a positive and beneficial therapeutic effect on the functional abilities of the hand in stroke survivors. This means that, according to the evidence gathered from these specific studies, patients who utilized these devices demonstrated improvements in their hand function.

Nonetheless, despite this promising conclusion, it is crucial to acknowledge that certain inherent limitations were identified within the body of the reviewed literature. These limitations represent aspects that temper the certainty and generalizability of the findings. Among these identified weaknesses were issues such as the relatively small number of participants involved in each study, a common challenge in much clinical research. Furthermore, several of the studies lacked the presence of a control group, which is a vital component for definitively attributing observed changes solely to the intervention being studied. Additionally, there was a notable variation in the specific protocols and methods employed in the interventions across the different studies, making direct comparisons more difficult.

In light of these identified limitations, this comprehensive review underscores a significant and pressing need. The current evidence, while suggestive of positive outcomes, necessitates further, more extensive, and more rigorously designed investigations. To definitively confirm and strengthen the understanding of the efficacy of these wearable robotic devices, it is imperative that future research endeavors involve larger sample sizes, thereby increasing statistical power and generalizability. Moreover, there is a strong emphasis placed on the adoption of standardized methodologies and protocols across studies. This standardization will allow for more consistent and comparable results, ultimately leading to a more robust and reliable body of evidence regarding the therapeutic benefits of wearable robotic gloves for improving hand function in stroke patients.
