This comprehensive systematic review delves deeply into the investigation of how a combination of advanced technological approaches, specifically exoskeletons, when integrated with either virtual reality (VR) environments, augmented reality (AR) overlays, or the motivational power of gamification, can be employed for the purpose of rehabilitating patients who have experienced a stroke. The overarching finding that has emerged from this extensive examination is that the synergistic utilization of these combined technological interventions demonstrably holds significant promise. This promise is primarily seen in its capacity to foster improvements in the motor functions of stroke survivors and, concurrently, to substantially enhance and sustain the level of engagement exhibited by these patients throughout their rehabilitation process.

It is important to note, as a key observation from the gathered research, that a considerable majority of the studies that were included in this review primarily concentrated their efforts and investigations on the rehabilitation of the upper limbs. However, a conspicuous and significant void in the existing body of research has been identified; this void pertains to the application of these combined technologies for the rehabilitation of the lower limbs. Furthermore, there is a distinct lack of research focusing on the implementation and effectiveness of these technologies when they are utilized in a home-based rehabilitation setting, outside of traditional clinical environments. In light of these findings, the review has also pinpointed a clear and pressing need for the development and implementation of rehabilitation games that are far more adaptable and personalized to the individual needs and progress of each patient. Moreover, the review underscores the necessity of further and more thorough exploration into the untapped potential that augmented reality (AR) possesses within this specific domain of stroke rehabilitation. In conclusion, this article unequivocally emphasizes the increasingly significant and evolving role that these types of interactive and technologically advanced interventions are playing in the recovery and rehabilitation of individuals who have suffered a stroke. Simultaneously, it candidly acknowledges and discusses the inherent challenges that are presently encountered in the critical transition and successful implementation of these novel therapies from clinical settings into the patient's own home environment.
