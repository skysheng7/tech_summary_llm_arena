This paper introduces a comprehensive approach to preparing high-quality initial states for quantum chemistry simulations on quantum computers, aiming to improve the efficiency and accuracy of quantum energy estimation algorithms. They also present an efficient quantum algorithm for preparing states as sums of Slater determinants and introduce a novel methodology for approximating energy distributions. The authors propose a new metric, the energy distribution, to assess the quality of these states and an end-to-end algorithm that includes state preparation, quality assessment, and refinement. The work highlights the potential of this approach to identify "Goldilocks problems" where quantum advantage is most likely and demonstrates its effectiveness through numerical examples on various molecules. Ultimately, this research addresses a critical bottleneck in quantum chemistry by providing tools and methods to obtain reliable initial states for quantum computing applications.
