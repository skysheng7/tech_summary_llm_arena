This pilot study investigated the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR)-based robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation in stroke patients with hemiplegia. The study found that the intervention group, which received VR-based robotic training alongside conventional rehabilitation, showed statistically significant improvements in lower limb motor function compared to the control group. Participants in the intervention group also demonstrated enhanced balancing function, walking ability, activities of daily living, and quality of life. However, global cognitive function did not show significant improvement between the groups. The study concluded that VR-based robotic training is a promising and feasible approach for stroke rehabilitation, supporting the need for larger-scale studies to validate its effectiveness.
