Here's the reordered summary, keeping all original sentence content:

This paper introduces new "no-go" theorems in quantum mechanics, unifying existing principles like no-cloning and no-deleting theorems. The authors propose a "no-encoding" theorem which states that it's impossible to linearly superpose an unknown pure state and a fixed state in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space using a universal quantum transformation. New superposing schemes are developed for unknown pure states in finite sets, and for cases where multiple copies of input states are available. The paper also presents unified schemes for perfect and imperfect quantum tasks such as cloning and deleting, which are characterized by the linear independence of input states. Ultimately, this work aims to provide a deeper understanding of quantum transformations and their limitations based on the superposition principle.
