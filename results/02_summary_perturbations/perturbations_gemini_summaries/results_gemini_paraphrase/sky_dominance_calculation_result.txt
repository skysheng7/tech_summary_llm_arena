Here are a few paraphrased versions of the summary, using different wording and sentence structures while retaining all original information:

**Paraphrase 1:**

The impact of competition intensity on dominance structures within dairy cow herds was examined in this research. Findings revealed that a rise in competition for food, evidenced by greater feeder utilization, resulted in a less pronounced dominance hierarchy. This shift toward a flatter hierarchy was attributed to subordinate cows exhibiting increased success in confronting their superiors, thereby generating more instances of mutual victories in interactions ("2-way dyads"). The study posits that under conditions of high competition, the perceived value of a resource can supersede inherent dominance traits, thereby shaping competitive outcomes. Consequently, it is advised to take the competitive environment into account when evaluating dominance hierarchies among dairy cows.

**Paraphrase 2:**

Investigating the relationship between competition levels and the establishment of dominance hierarchies in dairy cows, this study observed that heightened competition for feed, as reflected by increased feeder occupancy, led to a leveling of the dominance structure. This flattening effect arose from subordinate cows more effectively challenging dominant individuals, leading to a greater frequency of "2-way dyads," where both animals achieved victories in their encounters. The research suggests that the value placed on resources can, in periods of intense competition, outweigh established dominance characteristics, thereby influencing who succeeds in competitive exchanges. Therefore, the study recommends that the situational context of competition should be a factor when assessing dominance hierarchies in dairy cows.

**Paraphrase 3:**

This study explored how varying degrees of competition influence the formation of dominance hierarchies in dairy cows. It was discovered that when competition for feed intensified, indicated by higher feeder occupancy, the established dominance hierarchy became less steep. This reduction in hierarchy steepness occurred because less dominant cows were more capable of challenging their superiors, resulting in an increase in "2-way dyads," characterized by each animal winning at least one interaction against the other. The study proposes that during intense competition, the importance assigned to a resource can override intrinsic dominance factors, thereby affecting competitive success. As a result, it is suggested that the competitive circumstances should be considered when appraising dominance hierarchies in dairy cows.
