Here are several paraphrased versions of the summary, each using different wording and sentence structures while preserving all the original information:

**Paraphrase 1 (Focus on Model Components):**

A novel multimodal system named DeBERTNeXT is presented for discerning fabricated news by integrating both textual and visual data. The architecture employs a pre-trained DeBERTa V3 model for processing text and a ConvNeXT Large model for image analysis. These models' extracted features are then combined through concatenation and subsequently passed to a classification layer. Evaluation results from the Fakeddit, Politifact, and Gossipcop datasets demonstrate that DeBERTNeXT surpasses current leading models in accuracy and other performance indicators. The researchers emphasize the difficulties inherent in multimodal fusion and the necessity for efficient models to address the escalating issue of fake news. Future research directions could involve the inclusion of extra data types, such as audio and video, to establish a more all-encompassing fake news detection mechanism.

**Paraphrase 2 (Focus on Purpose and Results):**

This research unveils DeBERTNeXT, a multimodal framework designed to identify fake news by leveraging both text and visual inputs. The model's design incorporates pre-trained DeBERTa V3 for text processing and ConvNeXT Large for image analysis, with their respective features being concatenated and then fed into a classification layer. Empirical testing on the Fakeddit, Politifact, and Gossipcop datasets reveals that DeBERTNeXT achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models across accuracy and other evaluation metrics. The authors underscore the complexities associated with multimodal fusion and the imperative for efficient models capable of managing the expanding proliferation of fake news. Potential future enhancements may involve the integration of additional modalities, such as audio and video, to create a more complete system for fake news detection.

**Paraphrase 3 (More Active Voice):**

DeBERTNeXT, a multimodal framework for detecting fake news, is introduced in this paper, combining textual and visual information. The model uses pre-trained DeBERTa V3 for text and ConvNeXT Large for images; it concatenates their features and feeds them into a classification layer. Experiments conducted on the Fakeddit, Politifact, and Gossipcop datasets show DeBERTNeXT outperforming current state-of-the-art models in accuracy and other metrics. The authors highlight the challenges of multimodal fusion and the need for efficient models to combat the growing volume of fake news. Future work might involve incorporating additional modalities like audio and video for a more comprehensive fake news detection system.

**Paraphrase 4 (Slightly Different Flow):**

To detect fake news, this paper presents DeBERTNeXT, a multimodal framework that fuses textual and visual information. The model's architecture relies on pre-trained DeBERTa V3 for text and ConvNeXT Large for images, with their features being concatenated and subsequently fed into a classification layer. Results from experiments on the Fakeddit, Politifact, and Gossipcop datasets indicate that DeBERTNeXT achieves higher accuracy and better performance on other metrics than existing state-of-the-art models. The authors draw attention to the difficulties of multimodal fusion and the requirement for efficient models to address the increasing prevalence of fake news. The possibility of future enhancements includes integrating further modalities like audio and video to build a more thorough fake news detection system.
