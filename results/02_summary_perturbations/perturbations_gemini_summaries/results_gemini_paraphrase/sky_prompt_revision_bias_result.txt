Generative AI, particularly OpenAI's DALL-E 3, produces a skewed and idealized depiction of livestock farming, omitting the actual conditions of intensive agricultural methods. Research indicated that DALL-E 3, due to its automated prompt refinement, invariably created idyllic scenes of cows in pastures and pigs in mud, even when instructed to produce factual representations. When this prompt revision feature was deactivated, the underlying model was capable of generating more truthful, indoor-oriented images that mirrored contemporary intensive farming, implying that the bias originates from the revision process. This overly idealized representation has the potential to perpetuate inaccuracies concerning animal agriculture, thereby impeding constructive conversations about animal well-being and the broader societal sustainability of farming. The researchers propose implementing AI transparency regulations, mandating the revelation of prompt revisions, and encouraging the creation of more authentic imagery as solutions.
