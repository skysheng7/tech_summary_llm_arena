Here are a few paraphrased versions of the summary, using different wording and sentence structures while retaining all the original information:

**Paraphrase 1:**

To determine the best way to update established prediction models for use with novel populations, this article introduces a closed testing procedure. This method progressively evaluates more intricate updating techniques, beginning with minor modifications like recalibrating the entire model and progressing to comprehensive revisions, all while safeguarding against Type I errors. The proposed approach seeks a balance between the necessity of model updates and the danger of overfitting, especially when dealing with limited sample sizes. The authors showcase the procedure through three clinical case studies, demonstrating its success in identifying simpler updating strategies when evidence supporting a complete model overhaul is scarce. Ultimately, the closed testing procedure is designed to avoid overfitting and yield more trustworthy predictions when existing models are adapted to new datasets.

**Paraphrase 2:**

A closed testing procedure is put forth in this article for the purpose of choosing the most suitable strategy for enhancing prediction models previously built, when they are implemented on new populations. The procedure systematically evaluates updating methods of escalating complexity, commencing with minimal changes such as recalibration across the board and advancing to complete model redevelopment, all while maintaining control over Type I error rates. This framework manages the requirement for updates against the potential for overfitting, particularly when sample sizes are small. The authors provide three clinical illustrations to demonstrate the procedure and its efficacy in selecting straightforward update methods when indications for substantial revision are weak. The objective of the closed testing procedure is to avert overfitting and guarantee enhanced prediction accuracy during the adaptation of existing models to new data.

**Paraphrase 3:**

This article presents a closed testing procedure designed to identify the optimal method for updating pre-existing prediction models when they are applied to new populations. The procedure involves a systematic evaluation of updating methods, progressing from less complex adjustments like recalibration to more comprehensive revisions, all while controlling for Type I errors. This methodology strikes a balance between the imperative for model updates and the risk of overfitting, especially when working with smaller sample sizes. The authors' presentation includes three clinical examples, highlighting the procedure's effectiveness in selecting parsimonious update strategies when evidence for a complete model revision is not strong. The core goal of the closed testing procedure is to prevent overfitting and ensure greater predictive reliability when adapting established models to new data.
