A new technique for evaluating lameness in dairy cattle is introduced in this research, which involves building a lameness ranking system based on data gathered from a large group of people and comparing pairs of cows. The researchers discovered that this approach yielded strong agreement among experienced evaluators and could be effectively implemented by individuals without prior training on Amazon MTurk. Furthermore, their utilization of a 5-milestone subsampling algorithm proved that a limited number of crowd workers and pairwise comparisons are sufficient to develop a dependable hierarchy. This proposed method provides a more detailed and effective substitute for conventional subjective methods of gait evaluation, paving the way for the development of extensive datasets essential for training sophisticated automated lameness detection systems. The study also indicates that this technique holds broad potential for labeling health-related information beyond just lameness assessment.
