A research effort explored how crowdsourcing, combined with machine learning, can be employed to evaluate lameness in dairy cows. The team created an online tool where individuals could view cow videos and assign lameness scores according to established guidelines. Their findings indicated that although single individuals struggled with precise lameness identification, pooling assessments from a substantial group of participants yielded a highly accurate outcome. This methodology offers a pathway to establishing a dependable and adaptable system for identifying lameness in dairy cattle, a significant concern for animal well-being. Furthermore, the research emphasizes the broader possibilities of utilizing crowdsourcing and machine learning for evaluating animal welfare.
