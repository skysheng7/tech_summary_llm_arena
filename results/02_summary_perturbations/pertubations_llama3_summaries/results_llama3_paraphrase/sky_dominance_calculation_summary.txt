Here's a paraphrased version of the summary:

The study explores how heightened competition can lead to a reduction in the distinctness of dominance structures, especially observed in social species such as dairy cows. Researchers employed both direct observation and theoretical modeling to examine how competitive pressures influence these social rankings. Their findings indicate that greater competition diminishes the upper hand of dominant individuals, resulting in a more equitable sharing of resources within the group. While this leveling of the social structure can benefit the overall well-being of all animals, it may also trigger elevated levels of aggression and stress, particularly in situations where group management is suboptimal or resources are insufficient.
