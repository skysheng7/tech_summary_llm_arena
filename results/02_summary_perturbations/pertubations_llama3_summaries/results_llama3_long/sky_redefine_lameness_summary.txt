This compilation of original papers, which are being summarized here, delves deeply into the multifaceted subject of detecting and quantifying lameness specifically within the population of dairy cattle. One of the presented research works introduces a completely new and innovative method for identifying lameness, a method that relies on the utilization of radar sensing technology for its detection capabilities. In parallel, another paper within this collection explores the use of camera-based technology as a means to achieve the same goal of lameness detection. Beyond the technological advancements in detection, the articles also address other crucial aspects related to lameness, such as the widespread occurrence or frequency of lameness within the population of dairy cows. Furthermore, the research examines how the specific kind or category of lesion that a cow might have can exert an influence on its experience of hyperalgesia, which is an increased sensitivity to pain. The papers also extend their scope to include discussions on the process of establishing benchmarks for cow comfort, specifically focusing on North American dairy farms that utilize freestall housing systems. Expanding on the methodology of assessment, certain papers within this collection dedicate themselves to exploring and discussing different ways and techniques for measuring the reliability of assessments made by multiple individuals or "raters" when they are evaluating the same phenomenon. They also delve into the dynamics of dominance hierarchies among cattle and further explore the capabilities of animal lameness detection by incorporating the use of a variety of different sensors and sophisticated algorithms. In summation, the collection of studies presented here effectively showcases a broad spectrum and a diverse array of different strategies and methodologies that are being employed to confront and resolve the persistent problem of lameness in dairy cattle.
