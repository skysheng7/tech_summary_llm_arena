Here is the summary converted into bullet points:

*   The article discusses a quantum process for simulating the behavior of a large system by entangling many smaller systems.
*   This process involves applying a sequence of linear maps, also known as quantum gates, to the input states.
*   A mathematical framework is provided for understanding how these quantum gates can be combined to achieve specific goals, such as creating a maximally entangled state or simulating the behavior of a complex system.
*   The authors also discuss some of the limitations and challenges associated with using this process to simulate complex systems.
*   Overall, the article contributes valuable understanding to the capabilities and limitations of quantum processing techniques.
