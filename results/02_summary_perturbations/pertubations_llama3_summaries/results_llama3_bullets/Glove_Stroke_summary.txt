Here is the summary converted into bullet points:

*   Robotic gloves are discussed for their effectiveness in improving hand function in stroke patients.
*   A review of existing studies indicates robotic gloves are beneficial for increasing hand movement and strength, and reducing spasticity.
*   There is limited evidence on the long-term effects of these devices.
*   More research is needed to determine their feasibility and effectiveness in clinical settings.
*   The authors emphasize the need for standardization of outcome measures and reporting of methodological quality in future studies.
*   Robotic gloves show potential as a treatment option for stroke patients with hand impairments, but further investigation is required to understand their benefits and limitations.
