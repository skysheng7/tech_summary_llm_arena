Here's the summary converted into bullet points:

*   Increased competition can flatten dominance hierarchies, especially in social animals like dairy cattle.
*   Observational studies and mathematical models were used by the authors to investigate the effects of competition on dominance hierarchies.
*   Increased competition leads to dominant individuals losing their advantage, resulting in a more equal resource distribution among group members.
*   This hierarchy flattening can improve the welfare of all animals in the group.
*   However, it can also result in increased aggression and stress, particularly if the group is poorly managed or lacks sufficient resources.
