Here is a summary of the article in 5 sentences, reordered:

The article presents a systematic review of exoskeletons with virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and gamification for stroke patients' rehabilitation. The review aims to summarize the existing evidence on the effectiveness of these technologies in improving motor function, cognitive function, and patient engagement during rehabilitation. The results show that most studies reported positive outcomes in terms of motor function improvement, with a few reporting improved cognitive function and patient engagement. The limitations of the reviewed studies are discussed, including small sample sizes, short follow-up periods, and variability in outcome measures. Overall, the review highlights the potential benefits of using VR, AR, and gamification to enhance stroke rehabilitation outcomes, but also emphasizes the need for further research with larger and more diverse participant groups.
