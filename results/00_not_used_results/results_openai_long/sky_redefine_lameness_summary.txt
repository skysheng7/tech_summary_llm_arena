## Summary: “Redefining lameness assessment: Constructing lameness hierarchy using crowd-sourced data” (Sheng et al., 2025)

### Problem
Dairy cow lameness is common, painful, and costly, but routine detection is difficult. Automated (computer-vision) lameness detection has struggled to be adopted on farms partly because:
- Training datasets are small and not diverse.
- Labels are often created using **subjective gait scoring** with **low reliability**, adding noise to model training.

### Proposed approach
The authors propose replacing absolute gait scores with a **pairwise comparison task**: show two cows walking side-by-side and ask, “Which cow is more lame?” Then integrate many pairwise results into a **continuous lameness ranking (“lameness hierarchy”)** using a Bayesian Elo-based method (**EloSteepness**), similar to how dominance hierarchies are built in animal behavior research.

### Data and study design (pilot)
- Videos collected from one research dairy farm.
- From a larger pool, **30 high-quality cow walking videos** were selected.
- All-vs-all pairing produced **435 video pairs**.

They compared:
1) **Traditional gait scoring** (5-point scale)  
   - **5 trained experts**, each scoring all 30 cows **3 times** (15 total scores per cow).
2) **Pairwise lameness comparisons**
   - **4 experts** completed all pairs.
   - **Crowd workers (MTurk)**: first screened for accuracy, then **22 qualified workers** completed the tasks.

### Key findings
#### 1) Traditional gait scoring was inconsistent
- **Intra-observer reliability**: average **ICC ≈ 0.62** (moderate).
- **Inter-observer reliability**: **ICC ≈ 0.44** (low), showing experts often disagree on absolute scores.
- To approximate a stable “average gait score,” you need multiple experts and repeated scoring.

#### 2) Pairwise-based lameness hierarchy was more reliable
- Expert-derived lameness hierarchies showed **high agreement**:
  - **ICC = 0.81** across expert hierarchies.
- The hierarchy aligned well with averaged gait scores:
  - **Spearman r = 0.77** between hierarchy position and mean gait score.

#### 3) Crowd workers could produce expert-like hierarchies
- Average pairwise judgments (crowd vs experts) across all pairs:
  - **ICC = 0.79**
- Agreement depended on how obvious the difference was:
  - Clear differences: **ICC = 0.91**
  - Subtle differences: **ICC = 0.32**
- Final lameness hierarchy from crowd workers vs experts:
  - **ICC = 0.85** (high agreement)

#### 4) Efficiency improvements: fewer comparisons and fewer workers
To make scaling feasible, they designed a **milestone-based subsampling algorithm**:
- Use 5 “milestone” cows spanning healthy → lame.
- Compare other cows sequentially against milestones until their position is determined.

Results:
- Reduced comparisons by **≥61%** vs doing all possible pairwise comparisons.
- Reliability plateaued at about **8 crowd workers per pair**, achieving strong agreement with both:
  - the full crowd dataset, and
  - expert hierarchies.

### Conclusions and implications
- Pairwise comparison + EloSteepness produces a **more reliable and more granular** lameness label than conventional gait scoring.
- Because the task is intuitive, **crowd sourcing can generate high-quality labels cheaply and quickly**, enabling creation of large training datasets for robust automated lameness detection.
- The approach may generalize to other health/medical video or image labeling tasks where expert labeling is expensive.

### Noted limitations
- Pilot dataset was small (30 cows) and from **one farm**.
- Crowd workers can be influenced by non-lameness factors (e.g., slipping, stopping).
- “Ground truth” remains imperfect (video gait ≠ confirmed pain/pathology); future work should link rankings to lesions, treatment response, and multi-farm conditions.
