## Summary: *Digital Health Technology for Stroke Rehabilitation in Canada: A Scoping Review* (Kheirollahzadeh et al., 2025)

### Purpose
This scoping review maps how **digital health technologies (DHTs)** have been studied and used for **stroke rehabilitation in Canada**, identifies **gaps** in the Canadian evidence base, and highlights implications for **clinical practice, research, and policy/funding**.

### Methods
- Followed the **Arksey & O’Malley** scoping review framework and **PRISMA-ScR** guidance.
- Databases searched (Jan 2023): **MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, CINAHL**, plus grey literature (Canadian theses, Google).
- From **163 records**, **14 Canadian studies (2010–2022)** were included.

### What the Canadian literature looks like (14 studies)
**Study designs**
- **4 qualitative** (28.6%)
- **4 RCTs** (28.6%) + **1 pilot RCT**
- **2 mixed-methods**
- Others: feasibility trial, case study approaches, repeated-measures design

**Populations and stroke phase**
- Most studies focused on **chronic stroke** (**~64%**).
- Fewer addressed **acute/subacute** stages.

**Settings**
- **Home-based**: **50%**
- **Institution-based**: **42.9%**
- A small number included both.

**Rehabilitation targets**
- Strong emphasis on **upper extremity (UE) function**: **~86%**
- Very limited focus on:
  - **Walking speed** (~7%)
  - **Sitting balance** (~7%)
  - Little to no focus on cognition, ADLs, mental health, etc.

### Technologies studied in Canada
The included studies most often examined:
- **Sensors / mobile or phone-supported programs** (50%)
- **Virtual reality (VR)** (42.9%)
- **Games/exergames** (28.6%)
- **Telerehabilitation** (28.6%) (often overlapping with VR)
- **Robotics** (14.3%)

### Main findings (what DHTs seem to do)
Across studies, DHTs were generally reported as **feasible** and often **effective or comparable to standard home programs**, especially when:
- Training is **personalized** and sufficiently challenging,
- Users receive **clinician guidance and motivational support**,
- **Family support** is available,
- Technology is **easy to use and reliable**.

Reported benefits included:
- Improvements in **UE motor function**, repetitions/intensity of practice, and sometimes **quality of life**, **confidence**, or **self-efficacy**
- Increased **engagement/motivation**, particularly with VR and game-based approaches

### Facilitators and barriers to adoption (implementation factors)
**Facilitators**
- Motivation and engagement (enjoyable, feedback-rich activities)
- Clinician support (coaching, troubleshooting, encouragement)
- Perceived usefulness and good technology performance
- Family encouragement/support (noted in home telerehab)

**Barriers**
- Technical issues (connectivity, system limits, usability problems)
- Setup burden and learning curve
- Cost, portability, and accessibility concerns (especially for robotics)
- Concerns about privacy and appropriateness (e.g., social media/gaming contexts)
- Communication challenges (e.g., miscommunication, possibly worsened by impairments like aphasia)

### Key gaps identified
The review highlights that Canadian research is:
- Concentrated on **UE rehabilitation**, **chronic phase**, and **home-based** models
- Limited in studying DHTs for **lower extremity mobility**, **cognition**, **ADLs**, **mental health**, and broader participation outcomes
- Limited in **large, high-quality RCTs** and in work addressing **equity and cultural relevance** (e.g., rural/remote and diverse populations)

### Authors’ conclusions and recommendations
DHTs in Canada show **promise** for improving stroke rehabilitation and expanding access (especially for remote communities), but broader and stronger evidence is needed. The authors recommend:
- More **high-quality trials**
- Expanding targets beyond UE (e.g., gait, ADLs, cognition, mental health)
- More attention to **acute/subacute** phases and transitions from hospital to home
- Better support for **implementation** (training, infrastructure, clinician buy-in)
- Designing for **equitable access**, including rural/remote and culturally diverse populations.

If you tell me your goal (e.g., a 150-word abstract, a slide-ready summary, or key takeaways for clinicians vs. policymakers), I can tailor the summary format and length.
