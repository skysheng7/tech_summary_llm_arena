## Summary

This paper tests whether dairy-cow dominance hierarchies inferred from feeder “displacement/replacement” events depend on the level of competition at the feeder.

### Purpose
Dominance hierarchies in cows are often calculated using agonistic interactions recorded right after fresh feed delivery, when competition is intense. The authors questioned whether interactions under high competition reflect true (“intrinsic”) dominance or instead reflect heightened motivation for a valued resource (fresh feed), potentially altering the inferred hierarchy.

### Methods
- **Animals & setting:** Dynamic group of **48 lactating Holstein cows** monitored for **10 months**; **159 cows** participated in total due to regular regrouping (about **6 cows exchanged every ~16 days**).
- **Data source:** **30 electronic feed bins** tracked individual visits. A validated algorithm detected **replacement events** (one cow leaving and another entering the same bin within **≤26 s**) as a proxy for displacements.
- **Competition measure:** **Feeder occupancy** at the second of each replacement (percentage of bins occupied, adjusting for empty bins).
- **Analysis:** Dominance hierarchies were built using **Elo-based methods (EloSteepness)** separately across **25 occupancy levels (≈13% to 100%)**, using equal-sized samples of replacements per level. Dyadic outcomes (one-way vs two-way relationships, win-rate shifts) were also evaluated.

### Key results
- **Replacements recorded:** **194,631** total (~**636/day**). Peaks occurred after fresh feed delivery, when occupancy was high.
- **Hierarchy flattened as competition increased:**
  - For each **1% increase in feeder occupancy**, **hierarchy steepness decreased** by **2.41 × 10⁻³** (very strong fit; **R² = 0.96**).
  - The hierarchy was steepest at low occupancy (steepness ~**0.61**) and shallowest at very high occupancy (steepness ~**0.39**).
- **More “two-way” dyads under high competition:**
  - For each **1% increase in occupancy**, **two-way dyads increased** by **0.13%** (R² = 0.84), indicating more rank reversals or bidirectional wins.
- **Subordinates gained success under high competition:**
  - From lowest to highest occupancy (using 5 broader bins for dyad tracking), there were **~7.6% more dyads** where the cow that was dominant at low occupancy began **losing proportionally more** at higher occupancy.
  - Dominants’ winning rates declined as occupancy rose; some dyads shifted from one-way to two-way or even flipped direction.

### Interpretation
The authors argue that during high competition—especially right after feed delivery—**resource valuation/motivation** (wanting fresh feed) can outweigh intrinsic dominance traits, allowing more subordinate cows to challenge and sometimes defeat dominants. This produces a **flatter inferred dominance hierarchy**.

### Main recommendation
Researchers should **avoid calculating dominance hierarchies solely from agonistic interactions during periods of high competition** (e.g., immediately after feed delivery). Instead, they should **consider context (competition level)** and sample interactions across a broader range of conditions.
