    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary identifies the paper’s core aims: (i) to find general forbidden principles (no-go theorems) unifying no-cloning/no-deleting/no-superposing, and (ii) to characterize when certain transformations (cloning/deleting/superposing) are possible on restricted sets. It could be slightly more explicit that the paper also seeks bounds/characterizations for success probabilities in one-shot schemes."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "All main claims are consistent with the paper: introduction of a no-encoding theorem; unification/generalization encompassing no-cloning, no-deleting, and no-superposing; characterization via linear independence for finite-set tasks; and superposition schemes with multiple copies. The summary does not include numerical values or detailed conditions, so there are no checkable numerical errors; however, it omits nuances (e.g., probabilistic/CP map framing, restricted conditions like fixed overlaps/permutations) rather than misstating them."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 7,
    "reasoning": "The writing is coherent and readable, but terms like \"CP map,\" \"universal quantum transformation,\" \"linear superpose,\" and \"linear independence\" are used without explanation. Given the technical audience this is acceptable, but it does not actively clarify terminology beyond minimal context."

  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "It follows the prompt exactly: the summary is 5 sentences, matching the requested length."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "It covers the three main contribution clusters from the abstract/introduction (new no-go theorem, unified cloning/deleting schemes, superposition schemes). It misses some important specifics emphasized in the paper: the one-shot probabilistic framework, the derived upper bounds on success probability (matrix norm/state-metric bounds), and the more detailed conditions for multi-copy superposition (fixed overlaps/permutation-based overlap constraints)."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "No unsupported or fabricated claims are present; every statement aligns with the paper’s stated contributions and themes, and the summary remains high-level without inventing results."
  },
  "total_score": 53,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary accurately captures the paper’s main thrust: a unifying perspective on quantum no-go theorems via a new no-encoding theorem, plus constructive schemes for cloning/deleting and restricted-set superposition tied to linear independence. Its main weakness is lack of key technical details (probabilistic CP-map setting and explicit success-probability bounds/conditions), but it avoids hallucinations and cleanly follows the 5-sentence constraint."
