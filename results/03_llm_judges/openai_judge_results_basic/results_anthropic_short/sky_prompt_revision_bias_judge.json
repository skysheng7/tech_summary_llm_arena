  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Clearly captures the central research aim: whether DALL·E 3’s prompt revision changes depictions of livestock farming (especially “realistic” requests and the effect of disabling revision), and notes the regional comparison component. It does not explicitly enumerate all four research questions, but it reflects them well."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Accurately reflects the key findings: default pastoral imagery; “typical/realistic” prompts still yielding pastoral scenes; disabling prompt revision producing more indoor/confinement depictions; and regional variation emerging when revision is inhibited. Minor imprecision: the paper notes disabling prompt revision was not consistently successful (especially for “reality” prompts), whereas the summary could be read as broadly successful."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Coherent, logically ordered, and uses key terms (prompt revision, coded gaze, misinformation) appropriately. However, it does not briefly define “coded gaze” or clarify what “prompt revision” entails beyond adding pastoral details (still mostly understandable in context)."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "Follows the prompt to provide a summary in exactly 5 sentences (5 vs. requested 5)."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Includes the main method/contrast (revision on vs. off), the primary results (pastoral bias vs. indoor depictions), and the normative implications (misinformation, public dialogue). Some methodological specifics (e.g., 4,800 images, 100 per prompt, use of GPT-4o for clustering) are omitted but not required for a 5-sentence summary."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "No clear unsupported claims. All main assertions are grounded in the provided paper sections (prompt revision causing pastoral additions; indoor depictions when revision inhibited; partial alignment with real-world statistics; coded gaze framing; misinformation risk)."
  },
  "total_score": 55,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is strong: it accurately states the paper’s research focus, core causal claim (prompt revision driving romanticized depictions), key experimental contrast (revision disabled), and major implications. Its main weakness is slight over-smoothing of an important nuance—prompt-revision inhibition was not reliably achievable for all “reality” prompts—though the overall conclusions remain faithful to the paper."
