    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Clearly identifies the central aim: replacing subjective gait scoring with a pairwise-comparison-based lameness hierarchy (via crowd-sourcing) to improve labeling reliability and scalability for automated detection datasets."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Key quantitative results match the paper: inter-observer gait scoring ICC around 0.44 and intra-observer around 0.62; expert hierarchy ICC = 0.81; crowd-vs-expert hierarchy ICC = 0.85; recommendation of 8 workers per pair and ~37% of comparisons. Minor imprecision: the summary frames gait scoring reliability as a single range (0.44–0.62) without distinguishing inter- vs intra-observer ICC, but the numbers themselves are consistent."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Coherent and readable; explains the core contrast (pairwise hierarchy vs gait scoring) and uses ICC appropriately. However, it does not briefly define ICC or what 'pairwise comparisons' entail (e.g., choosing which cow is more lame), and it omits the Elo/EloSteepness concept that is central to how the hierarchy is constructed."

  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "Provides exactly 5 sentences, matching the prompt requirement."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Covers the main problem, proposed method, main comparative reliability findings, crowd-worker feasibility, and the subsampling efficiency result, all of which are highly relevant. Missing some secondary but notable details (e.g., pilot size of 30 videos/435 pairs and the EloSteepness/Bayesian ranking framing), but those are not strictly required in a 5-sentence summary."

  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "No clear unsupported claims; all major statements are grounded in the provided paper excerpt and align with reported results."
  },
  "total_score": 55,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is concise, follows the 5-sentence constraint, and accurately captures the paper’s core contribution and main quantitative findings about reliability and labeling efficiency. It could be improved by briefly naming/explaining the Elo/EloSteepness ranking approach and clarifying that the reported gait-scoring ICC values refer to different intra- vs inter-observer reliabilities."
