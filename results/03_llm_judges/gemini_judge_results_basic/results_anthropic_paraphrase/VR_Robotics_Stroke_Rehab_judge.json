  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summaries accurately capture the core research question of the paper, which is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of VR-based robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation in stroke patients with hemiplegia."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All three paraphrased summaries accurately report the key findings, including the number of participants, the intervention details (duration, frequency), the significant improvements in motor function, balance, walking, daily living, and quality of life, and the lack of significant difference in cognitive function. Numerical data like mean differences are also correctly presented."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summaries effectively use and integrate technical terms like 'hemiplegia,' 'virtual reality (VR),' 'robotic training,' 'motor function,' and 'cognitive function' within the context of the study. The language is coherent and flows well, making the information accessible."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. All three provided summaries are significantly longer than 5 sentences (Paraphrase 1 has 6 sentences, Paraphrase 2 has 6 sentences, and Paraphrase 3 has 6 sentences). This is a direct failure to follow the length constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summaries are comprehensive, covering the study design, participant groups, intervention details, key results for both primary and secondary outcomes, safety findings, and the study's conclusions regarding feasibility and the need for further research. All information is highly relevant to the research paper."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summaries are well-grounded in the provided text and do not introduce any unsupported claims or information not present in the original paper."
  },
  "total_score": 50,
  "overall_assessment": "These summaries are excellent in their factual accuracy, completeness, and coherence, effectively conveying the study's findings and implications. However, they critically fail to adhere to the explicit 5-sentence limit requested in the prompt, significantly impacting their adherence to instructions."
