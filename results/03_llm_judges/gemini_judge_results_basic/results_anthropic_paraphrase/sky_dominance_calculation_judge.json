{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the core research question: how dominance hierarchies change with varying levels of competition at feeding sites."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The numerical data and trends presented in the summary accurately reflect the findings of the original paper, including the decrease in steepness, increase in 2-way dyads, and the percentage of interactions lost by dominant individuals."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Key terms like 'dominance hierarchy', 'competition', 'feeder occupancy', and 'dyads' are used appropriately. While 'feeder usage' could be more precise, the context makes it understandable. The flow between sentences is logical and easy to follow."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is precisely 5 sentences long, directly adhering to the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the most crucial aspects of the paper: the research objective, the main findings (flattening hierarchy, impact of competition), the proposed mechanism (resource valuation over intrinsic attributes), and the key recommendation for future research. All points are highly relevant."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary strictly adheres to the information presented in the original paper and does not introduce any unsupported claims or external information."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent, accurately reflecting the paper's core findings and recommendations within the strict sentence limit. It effectively communicates the complex relationship between competition and dominance hierarchies in dairy cows."
