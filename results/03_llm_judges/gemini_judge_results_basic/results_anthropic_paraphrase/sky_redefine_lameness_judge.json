{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately identifies the core research question of developing a novel, reliable, and cost-effective method for lameness assessment in dairy cows using crowd-sourced data and pairwise comparisons."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The numerical values for ICC scores (0.44-0.62 for traditional, 0.81 for experts, 0.85 for crowd workers) and the percentage of comparisons (37%) are consistent with the paper. The number of crowd workers (8) is also accurate."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses technical terms like 'lameness hierarchy,' 'pairwise comparisons,' and 'ICC' effectively. It coherently explains how these are applied and contrasted with traditional methods. 'Crowd-sourced data' is also well-integrated."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a summary in 5 sentences. All provided versions of the summary are longer than 5 sentences (Version 1: 6 sentences, Version 2: 6 sentences, Version 3: 6 sentences). Therefore, the prompt was not strictly followed in terms of sentence count."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the key aspects of the study: the novel method, its comparison with traditional methods, the reliability of experts and crowd workers, the efficiency findings (number of workers and comparisons), and the overall benefit for automated detection systems. All points are highly relevant."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the information presented in the research paper and does not introduce any unsupported claims or fabricated details."
  },
  "total_score": 54,
  "overall_assessment": "The summaries effectively capture the essence of the research, detailing the novel lameness assessment method, its superior reliability compared to traditional techniques, and the efficiency gains from using crowd-sourced data. However, all versions exceed the requested 5-sentence limit, which is a minor deviation from the prompt."
