  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the research question: to review and categorize studies on exoskeleton robotics combined with VR, AR, or gamification for stroke rehabilitation, assessing their effectiveness and identifying trends and challenges."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings and methodologies presented in the paper, including the number of studies, participants, focus on upper limb, and the absence of AR studies."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Key terms like VR, AR, gamification, exoskeleton, and PRISMA are used appropriately. While not explicitly explained, their context within the summary makes their meaning clear. The summary flows logically and coherently."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary is significantly longer than the requested 5 sentences. It is over 500 words and comprises multiple paragraphs, failing to adhere to the sentence limit."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is very comprehensive and relevant to the paper's content. However, due to its excessive length, it goes beyond what a concise 5-sentence summary would entail. It covers the methodology, findings, and conclusions in great detail, making it less of a summary and more of an abstract expansion."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All information presented in the summary is directly supported by the content of the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 44,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is exceptionally detailed and accurately captures the essence of the research paper, including its methodology, findings, and conclusions. However, it fundamentally fails to adhere to the prompt's constraint of a 5-sentence summary, making it overly verbose and not a true summary."
