  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the central research question about the therapeutic effects of wearable robotic gloves on hand function in stroke patients. It sets the stage for the review's investigation."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the details presented in the original paper, including the number of initial records (2674), included studies (5), participant range (3-13), types of devices, intervention approaches, quality assessment scores (7-10/12), and limitations like the absence of RCTs and control groups."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses technical terms appropriately and explains concepts like 'chronic' and 'subacute' stroke, and 'task-oriented practice' well. The flow is logical and easy to follow."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,

  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the essential aspects of the original paper: the research question, methodology, key findings, the devices studied, intervention characteristics, quality assessment, and limitations/conclusions. It is highly relevant to the source material."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary stays strictly within the bounds of the information presented in the original paper and does not introduce any unsupported claims or fabricated details."
  },
  "total_score": 48,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is very comprehensive and factually accurate, providing a detailed overview of the research paper. However, it fails significantly on the prompt requirement of being a 5-sentence summary, offering a much longer narrative instead."
