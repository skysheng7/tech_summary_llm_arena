{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the core research question of the paper: proposing and validating a novel, crowd-sourced method for constructing a lameness hierarchy for dairy cows as an improvement over traditional subjective gait scoring."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary correctly cites numerical values for ICCs (0.81, 0.62, 0.44, 0.85), sample sizes (30 videos, 435 pairs), and the reduction in comparisons (61%), and the recommended number of crowd workers (8). All factual claims are supported by the text."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary defines key terms like 'lameness hierarchy' and explains the EloSteepness method and its Bayesian approach. It also contrasts this with traditional gait scoring effectively. The explanation of pairwise comparison is clear. The term 'milestone-based approach' for subsampling is mentioned but not fully explained within the summary itself, slightly impacting coherence."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The original prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. This summary is significantly longer, exceeding 25 sentences. The user-provided summary also explicitly states it is a 'rewritten, longer version' which directly contradicts the prompt's sentence limit."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the main aspects of the paper: the problem, the proposed solution (EloSteepness, pairwise comparison, crowd-sourcing), the methodology, the results comparing expert vs. crowd workers and traditional scoring, the efficiency findings (subsampling), and the overall conclusion. It remains highly relevant to the original paper."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the information presented in the research paper and does not introduce any unsupported claims or fabricated information."
  },
  "total_score": 49,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is highly comprehensive and factually accurate, effectively detailing the paper's methodology and findings. However, it fails significantly in adhering to the prompt's constraint of a 5-sentence summary, being excessively long."
