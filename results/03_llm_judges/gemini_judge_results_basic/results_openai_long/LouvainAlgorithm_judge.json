  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The research question is clearly about developing a fast and effective method for community detection in large networks, which is well-captured by the summary."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the core concepts of the paper, including the two-phase algorithm, modularity optimization, speed improvements, and application to real-world data."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Key terms like 'modularity,' 'heuristic,' 'meta-network,' and 'multi-resolution' are explained or used in a context that makes their meaning clear. The flow is generally coherent, though the summary is quite verbose."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is significantly longer, spanning multiple paragraphs. This is a clear failure to adhere to the prompt's constraints."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "While the summary covers the main points, its extreme verbosity and repetitive nature detract from its effectiveness. It could have been more concise and directly addressed the prompt's sentence limit. The last sentence is cut off."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary sticks to the information presented in the paper and does not introduce any unsupported or fabricated claims."
  },
  "total_score": 44,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary accurately captures the technical details and contributions of the research paper, particularly its novel algorithm for community detection. However, it fundamentally fails to follow the prompt's instruction for a 5-sentence summary, being excessively long and verbose."
