  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the central research question: to unify and generalize existing quantum 'no-go' theorems and explore new transformations within restricted quantum state sets."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings and theorems presented in the paper, including the no-encoding theorem, its generalizations, the unification schemes, and the proposed superposition protocols."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate technical terms like 'no-cloning,' 'no-deleting,' 'no-superposing,' 'completely positive map,' 'linear superposition,' and 'linear independence.' The points are logically structured and coherent."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a summary in 5 sentences. The provided summary is presented as a list of 8 bullet points, failing to adhere to the sentence count constraint. Even if considered as 8 separate sentences, it exceeds the limit."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the major contributions of the paper: the unified no-go theorems, the one-shot framework for cloning/deleting, the characterization by linear independence, generalized bounds, and the new superposition schemes. It is highly relevant to the paper's content."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the provided text of the research paper. No external or unsupported information has been introduced."
  },
  "total_score": 48,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is comprehensive and factually accurate, effectively capturing the core contributions of the research paper. However, it completely fails to adhere to the prompt's strict requirement of a 5-sentence summary, presenting the information as a list of 8 bullet points instead."
