  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the text of the original article, including the framing as 'stocking fillers,' the origin of the list from an internal survey, and the specific examples of statistical issues."

  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses clear language and explains the purpose of the statistical issues in a coherent manner. While it mentions specific statistical concepts (e.g., dichotomizing continuous variables, meta-regression), it doesn't delve into their explanation, which is appropriate for a brief summary. The overall coherence is high."

    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the main purpose and key takeaways of the article. It highlights the framing, the origin of the list, provides examples of the statistical issues, and mentions the ultimate goal of improving research quality and reducing reviewer workload. All points are highly relevant to the article's content."
