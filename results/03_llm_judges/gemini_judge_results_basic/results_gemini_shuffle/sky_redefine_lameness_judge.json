  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the core research question of developing a novel, efficient, and reliable method for lameness assessment using crowd-sourced data and pairwise comparisons to construct a lameness hierarchy."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings and methods described in the paper, including the use of crowd-sourcing, pairwise comparisons, the 5-milestone subsampling algorithm, high inter-observer reliability, and the comparison to traditional gait scoring."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'lameness hierarchy,' 'pairwise comparisons,' and 'subsampling algorithm' which are central to the paper. While it doesn't explicitly define them, their context within the summary makes them reasonably understandable for someone reading the abstract. 'Inter-observer reliability' is a key term that is used correctly."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary consists of exactly 5 sentences as requested by the prompt."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most important aspects of the paper: the proposed method, its validation with crowd workers and experts, its efficiency, its advantages over traditional methods, and its potential applications. It effectively distills the essence of the research."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not contain any unsupported claims or information not present in the original paper."
