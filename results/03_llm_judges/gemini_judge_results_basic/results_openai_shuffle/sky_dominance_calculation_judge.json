  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly states the central research question of the study: whether dominance hierarchies change with competition intensity in dairy cows."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings of the study, including the decrease in hierarchy steepness with increased competition, the rise in two-way dyads, and the proportional increase in losses for dominant individuals at higher occupancy levels. The numerical data mentioned (25 occupancy levels, highest occupancy vs. lowest) are consistent with the paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate technical terms like 'dominance hierarchies', 'feeder occupancy', 'Elo-based hierarchies', and 'dyads' coherently. The concept of 'flattening' and 'two-way dyads' is explained implicitly through their context and effect on dominance."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary has 5 sentences. However, the prompt asked for the summary in a specific order, and the response states the sentences were reordered but then provides them in a logical flow that aligns with the research question and findings. Without seeing the original ordering of these 5 sentences, it's difficult to perfectly assess prompt adherence to the ordering request, but the content itself fits the sentence count."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the most critical aspects of the study: the research question, the methodology (feeder occupancy, Elo-based hierarchies), the main findings (hierarchy flattening, two-way dyads, dominant cow losses), and the overall conclusion regarding the influence of competition and resource valuation."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the information present in the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 55,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary effectively captures the core research question and findings of the paper, accurately reflecting the study's conclusions about how competition affects dairy cow dominance hierarchies. It uses appropriate terminology and is factually sound, though the claim about reordering sentences needs further clarification if strict prompt adherence was required."
