{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately identifies the core research question: developing and evaluating a closed testing procedure for selecting prediction model update methods."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the methods proposed (recalibration in large, recalibration, model revision), the procedure (closed testing, sequential LRTs), the examples used, and the findings from simulations (Type I error, MSE)."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Key terms like 'closed testing procedure', 'recalibration in the large', 'recalibration', and 'model revision' are mentioned and their increasing complexity is noted. The concept of preventing overfitting is also clearly conveyed. It could be slightly improved by briefly explaining what 'Type I error rate' means in this context."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, directly fulfilling the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all essential aspects: the proposed method, the rationale behind it (preventing overfitting), the types of updates considered, the validation through examples, and simulation results supporting its utility."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the original paper."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that perfectly follows the prompt's length constraint. It accurately captures the research question, methodology, findings, and implications of the paper, using appropriate terminology and demonstrating strong factual accuracy."
