{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the central research question of the paper: investigating quantum transformations (forbidden/permitted) governed by the superposition principle and unifying existing no-go theorems."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key contributions of the paper, including the no-encoding theorem, the unified transformation scheme, and the generalization of superposition schemes. It correctly states that the no-encoding theorem unifies existing theorems and that the schemes are characterized by linear independence and matrix properties."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate technical terms like 'superposition principle,' 'no-cloning theorem,' 'no-deleting theorem,' 'no-superposing theorem,' 'linear independence,' 'Hadamard products,' and 'Schur product theorem.' While it lists these terms, it doesn't explain them in detail, assuming reader familiarity, which is acceptable for a technical summary but limits the score for 'explanation'."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a summary in 5 sentences. The provided summary is presented as a numbered list with 5 main points and an introductory sentence, totaling 6 points of information and not adhering to the sentence constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most important contributions and aspects of the paper, including the theoretical findings (no-go theorems, unification), the proposed schemes, the underlying mathematical tools, and the practical implications. It is highly relevant to the paper's content."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the content of the paper without introducing any unsupported claims or information not present in the original text."
  },
  "total_score": 48,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary effectively captures the core research questions and contributions of the paper, accurately detailing the theoretical and practical aspects. However, it fails to adhere to the prompt's strict sentence limit by presenting the information in a bulleted list format instead of prose."
