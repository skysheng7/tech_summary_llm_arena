{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the central research question: demonstrating unconditional quantum advantages without relying on previous strong assumptions or structured oracles."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the main results concerning cryptographic separations, NP search problems, proofs of quantumness, certifiable randomness, and the technical approach. The use of Reed-Solomon codes and QFT is correctly mentioned."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses technical terms like 'random oracles,' 'one-way,' 'collision-resistant,' 'proofs of quantumness,' 'certifiable randomness,' 'NP search problems,' 'Reed-Solomon codes,' and 'quantum Fourier transforms.' While these are central to the paper, their explanations are brief within the summary context. The coherence is good, but a deeper explanation would enhance understanding for a broader audience."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided output is structured with an introduction and then bullet points, exceeding the requested format and sentence count. The bullet points themselves are not sentences. The introduction alone has 2 sentences, followed by 5 bullet points, and the final bullet point is a long sentence."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the major contributions and technical underpinnings of the paper, including the separation results, the core cryptographic primitives discussed, and the underlying coding theory approach. It is highly relevant to the paper's content."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the content of the paper and does not introduce any unsupported or false claims."
  },
  "total_score": 47,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary provides a comprehensive and factually accurate overview of the paper's key contributions. However, it completely fails to adhere to the requested format and sentence count, presenting information in a bulleted list structure rather than a 5-sentence summary."
