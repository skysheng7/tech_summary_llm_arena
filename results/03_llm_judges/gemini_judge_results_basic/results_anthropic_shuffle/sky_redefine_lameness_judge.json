  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the core research question: to develop and evaluate a novel method for lameness assessment in dairy cows using a crowd-sourced, pairwise comparison approach to construct a lameness hierarchy."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical values and findings presented in the summary (e.g., ICC scores, number of workers, percentage of comparisons) accurately reflect the information provided in the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses technical terms like 'lameness hierarchy,' 'pairwise comparisons,' and 'ICC' effectively. While 'ICC' (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient) is not explicitly explained, its context within reliability discussions makes its meaning inferable for a reader familiar with research methodologies. The coherence is high."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary consists of exactly 5 sentences, directly adhering to the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most critical aspects of the paper: the proposed method, its comparison to traditional methods, the role of crowd workers, the efficiency gains through subsampling, and the overall significance of the approach for lameness detection."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is entirely based on the provided text and does not introduce any unsupported or fabricated information."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that accurately captures the essence of the research paper within the requested sentence limit. It effectively highlights the novel methodology, its superior reliability compared to traditional methods, the feasibility of using crowd workers, and the efficiency gains achieved, making it highly informative and relevant."
