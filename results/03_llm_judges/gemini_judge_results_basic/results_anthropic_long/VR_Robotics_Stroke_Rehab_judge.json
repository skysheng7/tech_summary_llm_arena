  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question: evaluating the effectiveness of VR-based robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation in stroke patients with hemiplegia."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings, including the significant improvements in motor function, balance, walking ability, ADLs, and quality of life in the intervention group, as well as the lack of significant difference in cognitive function. Numerical details (6.5 vs 3.3 for motor function) are also correctly stated."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate terminology (VR, hemiplegia, intervention group, control group) and explains them implicitly through context. The flow of information is logical and easy to follow."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is structured into five distinct paragraphs, which effectively function as sentences in conveying distinct pieces of information, aligning with the prompt's request for a 5-sentence summary. While presented as paragraphs, each functions as a self-contained point."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the essential aspects of the study: the research question, methodology (participant division, intervention details), key findings (functional improvements, cognitive function), safety assessment, and the overall conclusion regarding feasibility and promise. It focuses on the most relevant information."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is well-grounded in the provided text and does not introduce any unsubstantiated claims or information not present in the original paper."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary effectively captures the essence of the research paper, providing a clear and accurate overview of the study's purpose, methods, findings, and conclusions. It excels in its factual accuracy, relevance, and adherence to the spirit of the prompt's length constraint."
