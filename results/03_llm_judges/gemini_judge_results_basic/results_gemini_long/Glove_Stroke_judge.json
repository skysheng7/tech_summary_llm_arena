{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the primary research question: the therapeutic effects of wearable robotic gloves on hand function in stroke patients."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the number of articles screened (2674), included (5), the conclusion about positive therapeutic effects, and the identified limitations (small sample size, lack of control groups, varied protocols)."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate terminology like 'systematic review', 'therapeutic effects', 'methodological quality', and 'limitations'. While 'stroke survivors' and 'hand function' are clear, the explanation of 'wearable robotic gloves' could be slightly more explicit for a general audience, though it is implied in context."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary is significantly longer than the requested 5 sentences. It is approximately 20 sentences long."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the key aspects of the paper: the research aim, methodology (screening process), results (number of studies, conclusion), limitations, and the call for future research. All points are highly relevant to the original article."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the information presented in the original document and does not introduce any unsupported claims or fabricated information."
  },
  "total_score": 48,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary provides a comprehensive and factually accurate overview of the research paper, effectively communicating its findings, limitations, and future directions. However, it significantly fails to adhere to the sentence limit specified in the prompt."
