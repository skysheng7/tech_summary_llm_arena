{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research question: to unify and extend existing 'no-go' theorems in quantum mechanics, particularly focusing on the limitations of quantum transformations like cloning, deleting, and superposing, and proposing new ones like 'no-encoding'."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings and concepts presented in the paper, including the introduction of the 'no-encoding' theorem, the unification of cloning and deleting tasks, and the role of linear independence and superposition. It correctly identifies the theorems and their implications."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary generally uses technical terms correctly and coherently. It explains concepts like 'no-go' theorems, no-cloning, no-deleting, and linear independence. However, terms like 'Hilbert space' and 'universal quantum transformation' could be slightly more elaborated for a broader audience, though they are standard in this field."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is significantly longer, consisting of multiple paragraphs and approximately 20 sentences. Therefore, it completely failed to adhere to the sentence limit."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "While the summary covers the main themes of the paper, it is overly verbose and repetitive, which detracts from its conciseness and efficiency. The prompt asked for a summary, and this expanded version reads more like a detailed abstract that restates ideas multiple times without adding new information. The request for 'no new facts' in the summary itself, while not part of the original prompt, is noted but irrelevant to the evaluation of the summary against the original prompt's requirements."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the content of the provided paper and does not introduce any unsupported claims or external information."
  },
  "total_score": 41,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary accurately captures the technical content and contributions of the research paper, explaining key 'no-go' theorems and proposed new ones. However, it significantly fails to follow the prompt's requirement for a 5-sentence summary, instead providing an overly long and repetitive explanation."
