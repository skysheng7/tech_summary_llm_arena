  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the core research question of the paper: investigating the therapeutic effects of wearable robotic gloves on hand function in stroke patients."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the findings and limitations discussed in the paper. It correctly notes the positive effects observed, the lack of extensive long-term data, and the need for standardization. The only minor inaccuracy is the claim that spasticity reduction was consistently observed across all studies; the paper indicates that studies often focused on patients with low spasticity and that it's unknown for higher levels. However, this is a nuanced point and the summary's overall factual accuracy is high."
