  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research question of the paper: to investigate the scalability and reliability of a crowdsourced, video-based method for assessing lameness in dairy cattle."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All points in the summary accurately reflect the findings and methods described in the original paper, including the use of crowd workers, the comparative assessment method, the agreement with experienced assessors, and the required number of workers."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses clear and understandable language. Terms like 'crowdsourced method,' 'lameness,' and 'comparative assessment' are implicitly understood in the context. The flow of bullet points is logical and coherent."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary, but the provided output is a list of 10 bullet points, which is significantly longer and in a different format."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the key aspects of the study: the method, participants, results, implications, and potential applications, which are highly relevant to the research question."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "There are no unsupported claims or information that is not present in the original paper. All points are directly derived from the text."
  },
  "total_score": 49,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is comprehensive and factually accurate, detailing the methodology, findings, and implications of the study. However, it fails to adhere to the prompt's requirement of a 5-sentence summary, presenting instead a list of bullet points."
