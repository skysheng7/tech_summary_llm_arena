{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the primary research question of the systematic review: investigating the therapeutic effects of wearable robotic gloves on hand function in stroke patients."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical data and key findings presented in the summary (e.g., 2674 articles screened, 5 studies included, moderate quality, limitations) are consistent with the provided article."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate terminology such as 'systematic review,' 'therapeutic effects,' 'hand function,' 'stroke patients,' 'methodological quality,' and 'inclusion criteria.' The points flow logically, creating a coherent overview."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is in bullet point format and contains 7 points, exceeding the requested sentence limit. The conversion to bullet points also deviates from the requested sentence structure."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the essential aspects of the paper: the review's objective, search scope, number of included studies, main findings (positive effects), limitations, and the call for future research. All points are highly relevant to the core content."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "There are no unsupported claims or fabricated information in the summary; all points are directly derived from the provided research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 54,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary effectively and accurately conveys the key findings and limitations of the systematic review. However, it fails to adhere to the prompt's specific request for a 5-sentence format, presenting the information as bullet points instead, which reduces its score for prompt following."
