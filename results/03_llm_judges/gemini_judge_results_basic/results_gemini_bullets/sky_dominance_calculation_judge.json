{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the core research question: how competition levels impact dominance hierarchies in dairy cows."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All factual claims made in the summary are directly supported by the text and are numerically accurate where relevant (e.g., 'flatter hierarchy', 'more 2-way dyads', resource valuation influencing success)."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Key terms like 'dominance hierarchy', 'feeder occupancy', and '2-way dyads' are used correctly and in a coherent manner. The concept of 'resource valuation' influencing 'competitive success' is also well-explained in the context."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary has 6 bullet points, which can be interpreted as 6 sentences. Therefore, it does not strictly follow the sentence count requirement."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most important findings and conclusions of the paper, including the relationship between competition and hierarchy steepness, the mechanism (2-way dyads, subordinate success), and the implications for understanding dominance."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "There are no unsupported claims or fabricated information in the summary; all points are directly derived from the provided research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 49,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary effectively captures the core findings and implications of the research, providing accurate and relevant information. Its main weakness is a slight deviation from the requested sentence count, offering 6 points instead of the requested 5."
