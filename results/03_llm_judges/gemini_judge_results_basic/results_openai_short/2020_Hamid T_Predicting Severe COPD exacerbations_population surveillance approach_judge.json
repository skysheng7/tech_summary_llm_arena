  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question: developing a population surveillance model using administrative data to predict severe COPD exacerbations."

  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All factual claims in the summary, including the data sources, timeframes, prediction models used, validation results (AUC values), and the best-performing model, are accurate according to the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate technical terms like 'COPD exacerbations,' 'administrative health data,' 'logistic regression,' 'random forest,' 'neural networks,' 'gradient boosting,' 'temporal validation,' 'AUC,' and 'calibration.' While these terms are not explicitly explained, they are used in a context that makes their meaning reasonably clear to someone familiar with the field. The coherence is excellent."

    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most crucial aspects of the paper: the objective, methodology, key findings (best model and its performance), and the implication/conclusion. All points are highly relevant to the core research."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "There are no unsupported claims or fabricated information in the summary. All statements are directly derived from the provided text."
