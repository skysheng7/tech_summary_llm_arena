{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the core research question of developing a fast and effective algorithm for community detection in large networks, focusing on modularity optimization and hierarchical structure."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All factual claims in the summary, including the algorithm's phases, computational efficiency, and application on the Belgian mobile phone network, are directly supported by the provided text."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Key terms like 'modularity optimization,' 'heuristic algorithm,' 'hierarchical community structure,' and the two-phase process are mentioned. While 'modularity' and 'community detection' are central, a brief explanation within the summary itself could enhance coherence for a less technical reader."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The original prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is presented as bullet points and contains 13 distinct points, significantly exceeding the requested sentence count."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is highly complete and relevant, covering the algorithm's methodology, performance (speed and quality), applications, and key findings such as hierarchical structure and application to the phone network."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not contain any unsupported claims or information not present in the original text."
  },
  "total_score": 47,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is factually accurate, comprehensive, and highly relevant to the original paper. However, it significantly deviates from the prompt's requirement of a 5-sentence summary by presenting the information as a list of 13 bullet points."
