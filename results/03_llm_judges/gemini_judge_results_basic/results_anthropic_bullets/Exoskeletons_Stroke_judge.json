{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question about the effectiveness of exoskeletons with VR, AR, or gamification for stroke rehabilitation."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All factual claims in the summary, such as the number of studies, participants, publication years, and focus on upper limb rehabilitation, are accurately represented from the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively uses and maintains the core technical terms (exoskeletons, VR, AR, gamification) without needing explicit explanations, and the points are presented coherently."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The original prompt requested a summary in 5 sentences. The provided summary, presented as bullet points, contains 13 distinct points, significantly exceeding the requested length and format."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "While the summary covers many relevant points from the paper, it includes a large number of bullet points (13), making it less concise than a 5-sentence summary should be. The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary, and this response is essentially a detailed outline."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the information presented in the original paper and does not introduce any unsupported or fabricated claims."
  },
  "total_score": 44,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is factually accurate and comprehensive in its coverage of the paper's key findings and conclusions. However, it critically fails to adhere to the prompt's constraint of a 5-sentence summary, instead providing a detailed bulleted list."
