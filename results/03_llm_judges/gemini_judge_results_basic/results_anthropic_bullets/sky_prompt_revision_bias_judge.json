  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the central research question: how DALL-E 3's prompt revision process affects the depiction of intensive livestock farming and whether it erases controversial realities."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All stated facts in the summary are consistent with the provided text, including the model used (DALL-E 3), the bias observed (pastoral imagery), the role of prompt revision, and the comparison with real-world statistics."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'prompt revision,' 'pastoral imagery,' and 'intensive livestock farming' correctly. The concept of 'coded gaze' is introduced and explained through its effect. The coherence is good, with each point logically following the previous one."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a summary in 5 sentences. The provided summary consists of 6 bullet points, which is not a 5-sentence summary. Even when considering the bullet points as individual sentences, there are 6, not 5."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the most important aspects of the paper: the core problem, the mechanism (prompt revision), the observed bias, the method to overcome it (disabling revision), the results of that method, and the implications of the findings. It remains highly relevant to the research question."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the content of the provided paper and does not introduce any unsupported claims or information."
  },
  "total_score": 49,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is excellent in its content, accuracy, and relevance, effectively capturing the core findings and implications of the research paper. However, it significantly fails to adhere to the prompt's constraint of providing a 5-sentence summary, instead offering 6 bullet points."
