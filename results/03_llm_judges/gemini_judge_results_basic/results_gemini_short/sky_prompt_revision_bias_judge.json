  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question: how DALL-E 3's prompt revision creates a biased and romanticized view of livestock farming by erasing intensive practices."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings of the paper, including the bias towards pastoral imagery, the role of prompt revision, and the contrast with intensive farming realities."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'prompt revision,' 'pastoral images,' and 'intensive farming' coherently. While 'coded gaze' is mentioned in the paper, its absence in the summary doesn't detract from overall coherence."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, perfectly adhering to the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most critical aspects: the problem (bias), the mechanism (prompt revision), the findings (pastoral vs. realistic imagery), the implications (misinformation, hindering dialogue), and the recommendations (transparency, disclosure). It omits some finer details of the methodology or specific regional data but remains highly relevant."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the provided text. There are no unsupported or fabricated statements."
  },
  "total_score": 57,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that effectively captures the essence of the research paper within the strict sentence limit. It accurately identifies the core problem, the mechanism, the findings, and the implications, making it highly informative and relevant."
