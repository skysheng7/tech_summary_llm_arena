  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the core research question of the paper, which is to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of VR-based robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation in stroke patients with hemiplegia."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All factual claims in the summary are directly supported by the text. Key findings such as significant improvements in motor function, balancing, walking, ADLs, and quality of life, as well as the lack of significant improvement in cognitive function, are correctly stated. The conclusion about the promising nature of the intervention is also accurate."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate terminology such as 'virtual reality (VR)-based robotic training,' 'hemiplegia,' 'lower limb motor function,' 'activities of daily living,' and 'quality of life.' The terms are used in a coherent and understandable manner within the context of the summary."
  },
