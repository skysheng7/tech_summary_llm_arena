{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the core research question: developing a novel, reliable, and efficient method for lameness assessment in dairy cows using crowd-sourced data and pairwise comparisons."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings and methodologies presented in the paper, including the use of crowd-sourcing, pairwise comparisons, the Elo-rating method (implied by 'lameness hierarchy'), subsampling algorithms, and the comparison to traditional gait scoring."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'lameness hierarchy,' 'crowd-sourced data,' and 'pairwise comparisons' effectively. It implicitly explains the concept by describing the methodology. While it doesn't explicitly define 'Elo-rating' or 'subsampling algorithm,' the context provided makes their function clear within the summary."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, directly adhering to the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most critical aspects of the paper: the proposed method, its effectiveness with both experts and crowd workers, the efficiency gained through subsampling, its advantages over traditional methods, and its potential applications. All points are highly relevant to the paper's contribution."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the research paper. There are no unsupported or fabricated statements."
  },
  "total_score": 57,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that effectively captures the essence of the research paper. It accurately presents the novel methodology, its key findings regarding reliability and efficiency, and its broader implications, all while perfectly adhering to the sentence limit."
