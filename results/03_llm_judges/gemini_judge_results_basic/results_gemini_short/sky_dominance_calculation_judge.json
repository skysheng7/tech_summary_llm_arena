  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the central research question of how competition levels influence dominance hierarchies in dairy cows, aligning perfectly with the paper's objective."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings of the study, including the flattening of the hierarchy with increased competition, the rise in 2-way dyads, and the influence of resource valuation over intrinsic attributes. The numerical relationships mentioned in the paper (e.g., flattened hierarchy, 2-way dyads) are conceptually represented accurately."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses key terms like 'dominance hierarchy,' 'feeder occupancy,' '2-way dyads,' and 'resource valuation' appropriately and explains their relationship within the context of the study coherently. The flow of information is logical and easy to understand."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary consists of exactly 5 sentences, directly adhering to the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the most critical aspects of the study: the core finding of a flattened hierarchy under competition, the mechanism (increased success of subordinates, more 2-way dyads), the proposed explanation (resource valuation), and the main recommendation. All points are highly relevant to the paper's conclusion."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the research paper. There are no unsupported or fabricated statements."
  },
  "total_score": 60,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that perfectly follows the prompt's length constraint and accurately captures the core findings and implications of the research. It is coherent, factually accurate, and uses terminology appropriately."
