  "research_question": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core research question of exploring digital health technologies for stroke rehabilitation in Canada, highlighting their use, potential, and challenges."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 6,
    "reasoning": "The summary states the article reviews 61 studies, but the abstract and text clearly indicate that 14 studies were included in the review. This is a significant factual inaccuracy regarding the scope of the review."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'telerehabilitation,' 'virtual reality,' and 'gaming technologies' coherently and without excessive jargon. The overall flow is good."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary, when converted from bullet points, contains exactly 5 sentences. However, the factual inaccuracy regarding the number of studies detracts from the overall quality."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 7,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the main points: the scope of technologies, their potential benefits, and the challenges. It misses some nuances like the focus on UE function and the specific Canadian context beyond a general mention."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 7,
    "reasoning": "The primary hallucination is the incorrect number of studies reviewed (61 instead of 14). Other points are generally supported by the text, although some are simplified."
  },
  "total_score": 41,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is presented clearly and addresses the main themes of the article, including the types of technologies, their potential benefits, and adoption challenges. However, it contains a significant factual error regarding the number of studies reviewed, which undermines its credibility."
