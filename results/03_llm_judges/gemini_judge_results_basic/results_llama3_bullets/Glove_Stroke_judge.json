{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary directly addresses the core research question of the paper: the therapeutic effects of wearable robotic gloves on improving hand function in stroke patients."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the findings of the paper. It correctly states that robotic gloves are beneficial, that there's limited long-term evidence, and the need for more research and standardization. It might slightly overstate the reduction in spasticity as a direct finding from all studies reviewed, as the paper notes spasticity assessment limitations."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'robotic gloves,' 'hand function,' 'stroke patients,' and 'spasticity' appropriately. It maintains coherence throughout. While it doesn't explicitly define these terms, they are used in a context that makes their meaning clear within the summary itself."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary is presented as 6 bullet points, exceeding the requested 5 sentences. The prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary, not bullet points."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most critical aspects of the paper: the benefits of robotic gloves, limitations of current research (limited long-term effects, sample size, lack of standardization), and the call for future research. It's highly relevant to the paper's content."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not contain any unsupported or fabricated information. All points are derived from the content of the original paper."
  },
  "total_score": 47,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary effectively captures the key findings and recommendations of the research paper, highlighting the potential of robotic gloves for stroke rehabilitation while acknowledging current limitations. However, it fails to adhere to the requested 5-sentence format by using bullet points and exceeding the sentence count."
