  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the central research question of how increased competition affects dominance hierarchies."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the study's findings that increased competition flattens hierarchies and leads to subordinates becoming more successful. However, the claim about 'improved welfare for all animals' and 'increased aggression and stress' as direct consequences is an interpretation that goes beyond the direct findings presented, particularly the stress aspect."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses clear language and explains the core concepts (competition, dominance hierarchies, flattening) in a coherent manner, making it easily understandable."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary strictly adheres to the 5-sentence limit as requested in the prompt."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the main findings about competition and hierarchy flattening and the use of models. It omits specific methodological details (like feeder occupancy) and the nuanced findings about 2-way dyads and negative changes in winning percentages. The discussion of welfare and aggression is an interpretation rather than a direct summary of results."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "While the core findings are accurate, the statement that increased competition leads to 'improved welfare for all animals' and 'increased aggression and stress' is an inferred consequence rather than a directly stated finding. The paper discusses potential welfare concerns related to increased agonistic interactions in overstocked environments but doesn't definitively conclude overall improved welfare or universally increased stress as a direct outcome of the hierarchy flattening itself. The paper suggests the opposite, that hierarchy flattening might reduce some conflicts, but also acknowledges potential for increased aggression if resources are limited."

  "total_score": 49,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary effectively captures the main theme of the article and adheres to the sentence limit. However, it makes some interpretive leaps regarding welfare and aggression that are not directly supported as primary findings in the text and omits some key nuances of the results."
