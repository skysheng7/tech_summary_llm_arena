{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary is a meta-response about not being able to perform the task, rather than addressing any research question from the paper."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is factually accurate in stating that the article was not provided and thus cannot be summarized. This is a correct assessment of the situation."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The response is coherent and uses clear language. There is no technical terminology from the paper that needs explanation, as the paper itself was not provided."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary of the *article*. The response did not summarize the article but instead explained why it couldn't. The sentence count is significantly higher than 5, and it failed to provide the requested summary."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary is not complete or relevant to the paper as the paper was not provided. It's a response about the lack of a paper, not a summary of one."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not hallucinate any content from the paper, as it correctly states that the paper was not provided."
  },
  "total_score": 30,
  "overall_assessment": "This response is a meta-response and does not fulfill the prompt's request to summarize the provided article. It correctly identifies that the article was missing, but fails entirely to provide a summary or adhere to the sentence limit."
