  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research questions: achieving quantum advantage beyond NP-complete problems, demonstrating quantumness with random oracles, creating quantum-insecure cryptographic tools, and exploring the role of structure."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the paper's main contributions, including quantum advantage for non-NP-complete problems, proofs of quantumness, quantum insecurity of classical crypto, the use of error-correcting codes and QFT, and reliance on the Aaronson-Ambainis conjecture. The mention of SHA2 instantiation is also correct."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary mentions key technical concepts like 'quantum advantage,' 'random oracles,' 'cryptographic tools,' 'error-correcting codes,' 'quantum Fourier transforms,' and the 'Aaronson-Ambainis conjecture.' While it doesn't explain them in depth, it uses them coherently within the context of the research. The language is generally clear."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary contains 6 sentences. While close, it does not strictly adhere to the sentence count constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most significant aspects of the paper, including the theoretical contributions and their practical implications. It highlights the departure from the 'structure' requirement and the distinction between classical and quantum random oracle models, which are central themes."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the provided paper sections."
  },
  "total_score": 50,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary provides a strong and largely accurate overview of the research paper's key findings and contributions. It effectively communicates the novelty and implications of the work. The only minor drawback is its slight deviation from the requested sentence count."
