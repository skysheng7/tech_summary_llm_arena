  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the main research goals: unifying quantum no-go theorems and investigating quantum transformations in restricted sets. It mentions the no-encoding theorem as the central contribution and the exploration of both impossibility and possibility results. Minor deduction because it could slightly better emphasize the three-part structure (no-go theorems, transformations in finite sets, and superposition schemes)."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately represents the paper's content without numerical errors. It correctly describes the no-encoding theorem, the relationship to no-cloning/no-deleting, the characterization by linear independence, and the superposition protocols. No specific numerical results are misrepresented."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 7,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses technical terms like 'completely positive map,' 'linear superposition,' 'no-cloning,' 'no-deleting,' and 'linear independence' appropriately but without explanation. For a general audience, terms like 'completely positive map' and 'one-shot framework' could be clearer. However, for a technical audience familiar with quantum information, the terminology is appropriate and coherent."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt explicitly requested a 5-sentence summary, but the provided summary consists of only 3 sentences (though they are long and complex). This is a clear deviation from the instruction."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all three main contributions of the paper: (1) the unified no-go theorems via the no-encoding theorem, (2) the framework for transformations in finite sets characterized by linear independence with bounds, and (3) the superposition protocols for restricted sets. It appropriately emphasizes the key results without overemphasizing any single aspect. Minor deduction for not mentioning the specific relationships shown in Fig. 1 or some of the corollaries, but these are secondary details."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements in the summary are directly supported by the paper. The no-encoding theorem is in Theorem 1, the unification of no-go theorems is in Section II, the finite-set transformations are in Section III (Theorem 5 and related results), the bounds are in inequalities (26) and (33), and the superposition schemes are in Section IV (Theorems 6-9)."
  },
  "total_score": 45,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary accurately and comprehensively captures the paper's main contributions, including the no-encoding theorem, the unified framework for transformations in finite sets, and the superposition protocols. However, it fails to follow the prompt's instruction for a 5-sentence format, providing only 3 sentences instead. The terminology is appropriate for a technical audience but could be more accessible with brief explanations."
