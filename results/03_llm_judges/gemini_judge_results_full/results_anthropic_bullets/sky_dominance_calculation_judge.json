{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly states the study's objective: to investigate how dominance hierarchies change with competition levels at feeding areas."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical values cited (e.g., hierarchy steepness decrease, percentage of two-way dyads, percentage of dominant individuals losing more) are accurately reflected from the paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'feeder occupancy,' 'dominance hierarchy steepness,' and 'two-way dyads.' While these are explained by their context and the findings, a brief, explicit definition of 'feeder occupancy' or 'dominance hierarchy steepness' could have improved clarity further."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided output is structured as bullet points and contains far more than 5 distinct points, failing to adhere to the sentence count constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research question, key findings (flattening hierarchy, specific percentage changes), interpretation (resource valuation over intrinsic attributes), and recommendations, which are the most important takeaways."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All information presented in the summary is directly supported by the content of the original research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 48,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary accurately and comprehensively conveys the core findings and recommendations of the paper, demonstrating a strong understanding of the research. However, it completely fails to adhere to the prompt's constraint of providing a 5-sentence summary, instead presenting a detailed bulleted list."
