{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question: to introduce a fast, heuristic algorithm for detecting community structure in large networks and evaluating its performance."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical and factual claims in the summary (e.g., network sizes, computation times, algorithm phases, validation on the Belgian mobile phone network) are directly supported by the paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'modularity optimization', 'heuristic algorithm', 'meta-networks', and 'hierarchical community structure'. While these are central to the paper, they are not explicitly explained. However, the context and the structured bullet points make the summary largely coherent and understandable for someone familiar with network analysis concepts. The prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary, and this is a bulleted list, which implies a lack of sentence structure and explanation within the format."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The original prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided output is a bulleted list containing 12 distinct points, which does not adhere to the sentence count or format requested."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most crucial aspects of the paper: the proposed algorithm, its methodology (two phases), its key advantages (speed, hierarchy), and its validation on a significant real-world dataset (Belgian mobile phone network), including specific findings about language communities."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements in the summary are directly derived from the content of the research paper and do not introduce any fabricated information."
  },
  "total_score": 48,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary effectively captures the core contributions and findings of the research paper, highlighting the proposed algorithm's speed and its successful application. However, it fails completely to adhere to the prompt's requirement of a 5-sentence summary, presenting instead a detailed bulleted list."
