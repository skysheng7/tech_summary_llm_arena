  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the core research question: proposing and evaluating a novel method for lameness assessment in dairy cows using a lameness hierarchy constructed from pairwise comparisons, contrasting it with traditional methods and assessing its feasibility with crowd workers."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical values, such as ICC scores (0.44-0.62 for traditional, 0.81 for experts, 0.85 for crowd vs. experts), the number of workers (8), and the percentage of comparisons (37%), are accurately reported from the paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'lameness hierarchy,' 'pairwise comparisons,' and 'ICC' which are central to the paper. While ICC is mentioned with its meaning of reliability, a deeper explanation of 'lameness hierarchy' might have been beneficial for a general audience. However, the points flow logically and are understandable."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt explicitly asked for a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is presented as a bulleted list with 14 points, failing to adhere to the sentence count constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the key contributions: the novel method, its comparison to traditional methods, its reliability, the feasibility with crowd workers, the efficiency gains (number of workers and comparisons), and the ultimate application for training automated systems. These are the main takeaways from the paper."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the information present in the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 48,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary effectively captures the essence and key findings of the research paper, accurately reporting all numerical data and highlighting the main contributions. However, it completely fails to follow the prompt's instruction to provide a 5-sentence summary, instead presenting a lengthy bulleted list."
