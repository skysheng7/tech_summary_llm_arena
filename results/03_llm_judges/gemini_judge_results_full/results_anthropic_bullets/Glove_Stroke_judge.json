{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The first bullet point clearly articulates the main research question of the systematic review: to examine the therapeutic effects of wearable robotic gloves on hand function in stroke patients."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical and factual details, such as the number of studies included (5), the range of participants (3-13), the methodological quality scores (7-10 out of 12), and the duration of interventions (4-6 weeks), are accurately reflected from the paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'systematic review', 'stroke patients', 'wearable robotic gloves', 'therapeutic effects', 'randomized controlled trials', and 'spasticity'. While these are standard terms in the field, brief explanations are not provided. However, the context generally makes them understandable. The bullet point format enhances coherence."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is a list of bullet points and far exceeds the requested sentence count, making it not follow the prompt's structure or length requirement."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the key aspects of the paper, including the research question, methodology (search strategy, number of studies), findings (positive effects, limitations), specific devices, intervention characteristics, and the concluding recommendations for future research. It covers the most important take-home messages comprehensively."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary, including the number of studies, participant details, limitations, devices used, and conclusions, are directly supported by the information present in the original research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 48,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is highly comprehensive and factually accurate, covering all key findings and limitations of the original paper. However, it completely fails to adhere to the prompt's requirement of a 5-sentence summary, instead providing a detailed bulleted list which makes it not follow the prompt at all."
