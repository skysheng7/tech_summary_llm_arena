  "research_question": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary implicitly addresses the research questions by stating the review's aim to examine DHT use in Canada and identify gaps. However, it doesn't explicitly list the specific research questions as stated in the introduction of the paper."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical data (14 studies, 2010-2022 publication range, focus on chronic phase and upper extremity) and general findings (feasibility, engagement, functional improvements, barriers) are accurately reflected from the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses common abbreviations like DHTs, RCTs, and ADLs, which are generally understood in the context of health research. The terminology used is coherent and easily understandable for someone familiar with the field. Terms like 'scoping review' and 'telerehabilitation' are used appropriately."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, as requested by the prompt."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the most critical aspects of the paper: the scope of the review, the types of studies included, the primary focus areas (chronic phase, UE), the technologies examined, key findings (feasibility, effectiveness, barriers), and the concluding recommendations for future research and practice. It highlights the key gaps identified and the need for broader outcome coverage and earlier phase intervention."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the original research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 55,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that accurately and concisely captures the core findings and recommendations of the research paper. It adheres perfectly to the prompt's sentence limit and effectively synthesizes complex information into an understandable overview, highlighting the study's main contributions and limitations."
