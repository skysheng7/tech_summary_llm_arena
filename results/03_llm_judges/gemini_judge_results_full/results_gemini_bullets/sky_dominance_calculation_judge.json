    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The first bullet point clearly states the study's objective: to investigate how competition levels affect dominance hierarchies in dairy cows."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical findings and observations mentioned in the summary align with the results presented in the paper, such as the flattening of the hierarchy with increased competition, the rise in 2-way dyads, and the influence of resource valuation."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Key terms like 'dominance hierarchy,' 'feeder occupancy,' and '2-way dyads' are used in context and are understandable. While 'resource valuation' and 'intrinsic dominance attributes' are used, their meaning is implicitly conveyed through the discussion of competitive success. No specific explanation was provided for these terms, but they are generally understood in the context of animal behavior."

  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is presented as 6 bullet points, which is not a sentence-based summary and exceeds the requested length."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the main findings: increased competition flattens the hierarchy, subordinates become more successful, leading to more 2-way dyads, and the importance of resource valuation over intrinsic attributes. It also includes the key recommendation regarding context in hierarchy assessment."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All points made in the summary are directly supported by the information presented in the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 48,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary provides a comprehensive and accurate overview of the study's main findings and conclusions. However, it fails to adhere to the prompt's instruction of providing a 5-sentence summary, instead presenting 6 bullet points."
