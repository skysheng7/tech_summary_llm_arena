  "research_question": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary implies the research question is about exploring a crowdsourced method for lameness assessment and its reliability, which is accurate. However, it doesn't explicitly state the research question in a single, concise sentence."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All the points in the bulleted summary are directly supported by the paper and accurately reflect the methods, findings, and implications."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'crowdsourced method,' 'Amazon Mechanical Turk,' and 'lameness assessment' which are understandable in context. It effectively explains the core concept of comparing videos side-by-side and relative rating. It could have benefited from a brief explanation of 'intraclass correlation coefficient' or the scale used (-3 to +3) for full clarity."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided output is a list of 10 bullet points, not a coherent paragraph of 5 sentences."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the most important aspects: the method (crowdsourcing, video comparison), the participants (crowd workers, experienced assessors), the key finding (high agreement with few workers), and the implications (cost-effective, data generation for AI, improved management). It touches upon all the major take-home messages."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All the statements made in the bullet points are directly supported by the content of the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 46,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary provides a comprehensive and factually accurate overview of the paper's key findings and implications. However, it fails to adhere to the prompt's specific instruction of providing a 5-sentence summary, instead presenting 10 bullet points."
