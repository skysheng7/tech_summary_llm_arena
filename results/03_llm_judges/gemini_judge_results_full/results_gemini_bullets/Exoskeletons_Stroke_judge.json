{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately identifies the core research question of the paper: examining the use of exoskeletons with VR, AR, or gamification for stroke rehabilitation."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All points in the summary are factually accurate and directly supported by the paper's findings. No numerical data was requested or provided, so this aspect is not applicable."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses clear language and the terms VR, AR, and gamification are central to the paper and are presented in context without requiring explicit explanation. The bullet points make the information easy to digest."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary, but the output is a list of 10 bullet points. This is a significant deviation from the prompt's instructions."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively covers the key findings, including the benefits (motor function, engagement), the focus on upper limbs, the gaps in lower limb and home-based rehabilitation, and future directions (customizable games, AR potential)."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the bullet points are directly supported by the content of the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 50,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is excellent in its content, accurately reflecting the key findings and gaps identified in the research paper. However, it completely fails to adhere to the prompt's request for a 5-sentence summary, instead providing a list of 10 bullet points."
