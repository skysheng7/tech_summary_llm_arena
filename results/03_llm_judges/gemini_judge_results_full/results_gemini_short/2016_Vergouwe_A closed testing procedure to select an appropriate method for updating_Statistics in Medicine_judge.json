  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the central research question: to propose and evaluate a closed testing procedure for selecting the best method to update prediction models for new populations."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the methods (closed testing procedure, incremental updating), rationale (balancing updating need vs. overfitting), and findings (effectiveness in selecting parsimonious methods, use of clinical examples) presented in the paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Key terms like 'closed testing procedure', 'updating prediction models', 'new populations', 'recalibration in the large', and 'model revision' are used appropriately. While 'Type I error' and 'overfitting' are not explicitly defined, they are used in a context that makes their meaning generally understandable to someone familiar with research methodology. The explanation of the procedure's systematic nature is clear."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, adhering precisely to the prompt's instruction."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core contribution of the paper: the proposed closed testing procedure, its purpose (selecting update methods, preventing overfitting), the balancing act it performs, and its validation through clinical examples. It highlights the main take-home message about selecting parsimonious methods when evidence is limited."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements in the summary are directly supported by the content of the research paper. There are no unsupported claims or fabricated information."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary effectively addresses the research question within the specified sentence limit. It accurately and concisely presents the core contribution of the paper, including its methodology, rationale, and demonstrated utility, without any factual inaccuracies or hallucinations."
