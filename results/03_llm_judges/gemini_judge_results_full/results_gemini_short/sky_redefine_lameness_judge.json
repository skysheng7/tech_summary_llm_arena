  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the core research question, which is to propose and evaluate a novel method for lameness assessment using crowd-sourced data and pairwise comparisons to construct a lameness hierarchy."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All the numerical and qualitative findings mentioned in the summary (high inter-observer reliability, feasibility for crowd workers, subsampling algorithm, comparison to traditional methods) are accurately reflected in the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'lameness hierarchy,' 'pairwise comparisons,' and 'crowd-sourced data' appropriately and in a coherent manner. It also contrasts the proposed method with 'traditional subjective gait scoring methods' without needing further explanation for a general audience within the scope of a summary."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary consists of exactly 5 sentences, adhering perfectly to the prompt's instruction."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively covers the key contributions: the proposed method, its reliability, the efficiency gained through subsampling, its advantage over traditional methods, and its broader applicability. These are the most important take-home messages."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 60,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent, perfectly following the prompt and accurately capturing the essence of the research paper. It clearly presents the novel method, its key findings regarding reliability and efficiency, and its implications, making it highly informative and relevant."
