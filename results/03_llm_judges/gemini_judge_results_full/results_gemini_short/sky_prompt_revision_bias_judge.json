  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the core research question: how generative AI models, specifically DALL-E 3, present a biased and romanticized view of livestock farming by erasing intensive farming realities."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings of the paper, including DALL-E 3's default pastoral imagery, the role of prompt revision in introducing bias, the ability of the base model to generate realistic depictions when revision is disabled, and the risks associated with misinformation and hindered dialogue."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is coherent and easy to understand. Terms like 'generative AI', 'DALL-E 3', 'prompt revision', and 'pastoral images' are used appropriately within the context and are generally understood."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, fulfilling the prompt's requirement."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the most important take-home messages: the bias in DALL-E 3, the mechanism (prompt revision), the contrast with reality, the implications (misinformation, hindered dialogue), and the proposed solutions. It is comprehensive for a 5-sentence summary."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements in the summary are directly supported by the content of the provided research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 60,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent, effectively capturing the essence of the research paper within the sentence constraint. It clearly identifies the problem, the mechanism, the findings, and the implications, while remaining factually accurate and coherent."
