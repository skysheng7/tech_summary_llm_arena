  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly states the study's aim: to investigate how competition levels affect dominance hierarchies in dairy cows."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the main findings of the paper, including the flattening of the hierarchy with increased competition, the increase in 2-way dyads, and the proposed explanation involving resource valuation."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'dominance hierarchy', 'feeder occupancy', and '2-way dyads' which are understandable in context. However, 'resource valuation' and 'intrinsic dominance attributes' could have benefited from a slightly more explicit explanation within the summary itself, although their meaning is inferable from the text."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, adhering perfectly to the prompt's request."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most crucial findings: the relationship between competition and hierarchy steepness, the mechanism (2-way dyads), the proposed explanation (resource valuation), and the practical recommendation. These are the core take-home messages."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the information presented in the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 58,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that perfectly follows the prompt's length constraint and accurately captures the core findings and implications of the research paper. It is coherent and factually sound, with only minor room for improvement in explicitly defining some nuanced terminology."
