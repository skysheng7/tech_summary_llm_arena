{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question: developing a fast and efficient algorithm for community detection in large networks that optimizes modularity and reveals hierarchical structures."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key aspects of the paper, including the method (modularity optimization, node movement, community aggregation), its advantages (speed, quality, hierarchical structure), and validation on large datasets. No factual inaccuracies were found."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'modularity optimization', 'community structures', 'meta-communities', and 'hierarchical structure' which are central to the paper. While these terms are not explicitly defined, their context within the summary makes them reasonably understandable for someone familiar with network analysis concepts. 'Multi-resolution community structures' is also used appropriately."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary consists of exactly 5 sentences, adhering precisely to the prompt's instruction."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the main contributions: the algorithm's novelty (fast, efficient, hierarchical), its core mechanism (modularity optimization, iterative passes), its validation, and its key benefits (speed, quality, multi-resolution analysis). It highlights the most important take-home messages."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the provided paper."
  },
  "total_score": 58,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that accurately captures the essence of the research paper. It effectively communicates the paper's contributions, methodology, and findings within the requested sentence limit. The only minor area for improvement would be slightly more explicit explanation of core technical terms, though they are generally inferable from context."
