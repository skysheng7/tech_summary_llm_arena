  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the primary research question which is to introduce a fast and efficient algorithm for uncovering community structures in large networks through modularity optimization."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the core methodology (iterative optimization, community aggregation, hierarchical structure) and its key advantages (speed, quality of detection, multi-resolution capabilities) as described in the paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'modularity optimization', 'meta-communities', and 'multi-resolution community structures' which are central to the paper. While not explicitly defined, their context within the description of the algorithm makes them relatively understandable to someone familiar with the general domain of network analysis. More explicit definitions might improve it slightly."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary consists of exactly 5 sentences, fulfilling the prompt's requirement."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the main contributions: the novel algorithm, its core mechanism, its efficiency, its validation on large datasets, and its hierarchical/multi-resolution nature, which are the most important takeaways from the paper."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent, accurately capturing the core contributions and methodology of the paper within the requested sentence limit. It clearly presents the algorithm's novelty, efficiency, and application, making it a highly relevant and well-written summary."
