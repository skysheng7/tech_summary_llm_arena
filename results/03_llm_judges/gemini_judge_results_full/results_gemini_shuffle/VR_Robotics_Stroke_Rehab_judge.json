  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly states the research question as investigating the effectiveness of VR-based robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation in stroke patients with hemiplegia."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All factual claims made in the summary, including the comparison of motor function improvements, benefits in balancing, walking, ADLs, and quality of life, and the lack of cognitive improvement, are accurately reflected from the paper's results and conclusion."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate terminology from the paper (e.g., VR-based robotic training, hemiplegia, motor function) without requiring extensive explanation, and the sentences flow logically to create a coherent overview."
  },

    "reasoning": "The summary consists of exactly 5 sentences, directly fulfilling the prompt's requirement."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core elements: the study's purpose, key findings regarding motor function and other outcomes, the non-significant finding for cognitive function, and the overall conclusion about feasibility and future research."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements in the summary are directly supported by the content of the research paper."
  },
