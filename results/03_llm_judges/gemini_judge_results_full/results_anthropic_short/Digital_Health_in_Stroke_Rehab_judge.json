  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research question of the paper, which is to explore the use of DHTs for stroke rehabilitation in Canada, identify gaps, and inform future decisions."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical data points cited in the summary (e.g., 85.71% for UE function, 64.3% for chronic phase, 50% for home settings) are accurate and directly from the original paper's abstract and results section."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses some technical terms like DHTs, RCTs, and specific rehabilitation outcomes (UE function, cognition, ADLs). While DHT is defined in the abstract, the others are not explicitly explained within the summary itself. However, the terms are relatively standard in the field and the overall coherence is good."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is precisely 5 sentences long, exactly as requested in the prompt."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively covers the most important aspects of the paper: the scope of the review, key findings on technology types and outcomes, facilitators and barriers, identified gaps, and future recommendations. It provides a comprehensive overview of the paper's contribution."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the information presented in the original paper, particularly in the abstract and discussion sections."
  },
  "total_score": 58,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent, adhering strictly to the sentence limit and accurately capturing the key findings, gaps, and recommendations of the original paper. Its only minor weakness is the lack of explicit definition for all technical terms, though they are generally understandable in context."
