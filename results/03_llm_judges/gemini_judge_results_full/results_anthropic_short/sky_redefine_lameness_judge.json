  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the central research question: to propose and evaluate a novel method for assessing lameness in dairy cows using a lameness hierarchy derived from crowd-sourced pairwise comparisons, as an alternative to traditional gait scoring."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical results (ICC values, number of workers, percentage of comparisons) are accurately presented as stated in the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'lameness hierarchy', 'pairwise comparisons', 'traditional gait scoring', and 'ICC'. While ICC is a common metric, it's not explicitly explained. However, the context provided (e.g., 'poor reliability' for low ICC, 'high inter-observer reliability' for high ICC) makes its meaning inferable. The overall coherence is high."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, directly adhering to the prompt's instruction."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the key contributions: the proposed method, its superiority in reliability over traditional methods, its feasibility with crowd workers, the efficiency gains through subsampling (number of workers and comparisons), and its potential for creating large datasets for AI training."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the information presented in the original research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that accurately reflects the core findings and contributions of the research paper. It is well-structured, factually accurate, and adheres perfectly to the prompt's sentence limit. The only minor improvement could be a brief explanation of ICC for broader understanding."
