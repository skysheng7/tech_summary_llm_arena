{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly states the research question in the first sentence: 'This systematic review examines the therapeutic effects of wearable robotic gloves on hand function improvement in stroke patients.'"
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the number of studies included (5), the range of participant numbers (3-13), the focus on chronic stroke patients with mild-moderate spasticity, the methodological quality scores (7-10/12), the types of devices, and the intervention duration (4-6 weeks)."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is easy to understand and does not rely on overly technical jargon. While it mentions specific devices (EPHO, PneuGlove, etc.), it places them in context as 'robotic glove devices used in interventions.' The overall flow is coherent."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, fulfilling the prompt's requirement."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the key takeaways: the general positive findings, the significant limitations (sample size, RCT absence, patient group), the types of devices and interventions, and the call for further research. These are the most important points from the paper."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All information presented in the summary is directly supported by the content of the provided paper."
  },
  "total_score": 60,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent, accurately reflecting the research question, findings, and limitations of the original paper within the requested sentence count. It is coherent, factually accurate, and avoids hallucinations, making it a highly relevant and complete representation of the study."
