  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the main research question: to provide a unified perspective on quantum 'no-go' theorems (no-cloning, no-superposing, no-deleting) by introducing a generalized 'no-encoding' theorem and developing frameworks for quantum transformations within restricted sets."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the core findings of the paper, including the introduction of the no-encoding theorem, its generalization of existing theorems, the development of a one-shot framework for cloning/deleting, the characterization by linear independence, the derivation of success probability bounds, and the construction of superposition protocols. There are no apparent factual errors."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses technical terms like 'no-cloning', 'no-superposing', 'no-deleting', 'no-encoding theorem', 'completely positive map', 'linear independence', 'matrix-norm', and 'state metric'. While these are central to the paper, a brief explanation or context for some might have enhanced coherence for a non-expert. However, for a summary of a technical paper, it is reasonably coherent."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is significantly longer, structured with headings and bullet points, and contains multiple paragraphs, far exceeding the requested sentence count."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively covers the key contributions of the paper: the theoretical framework (no-encoding theorem), the practical implications (one-shot frameworks, success probabilities), and the constructive aspects (protocols for superposition). It prioritizes the most important take-home messages."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the provided paper sections. No external information or unsupported claims are introduced."
  },
  "total_score": 45,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary excels in accurately capturing the core research question, key findings, and technical contributions of the paper, offering a comprehensive overview of its theoretical and practical advancements. However, it critically fails to adhere to the prompt's explicit instruction for a 5-sentence summary, providing a much more detailed, multi-paragraph response instead."
