{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the core research question of the paper, which is to investigate the effectiveness and trends of exoskeleton-based rehabilitation combined with VR, AR, or gamification for poststroke patients."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key factual information from the paper, including the timeframe of the studies (2010-2017), the number of studies (30), the approximate number of participants (385), the focus on upper limbs (28/30), the setting (25/30 in clinics), and the types of outcome measures. It also correctly notes the absence of AR in the selected literature."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate terminology (VR, AR, gamification, exoskeleton) and explains the overall purpose and context well. While some terms like 'PRISMA guidelines' or specific assessment scales are mentioned without explicit explanation, they are presented in a context that allows for general understanding. The coherence is high."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The original prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary has 5 sentences. However, the prompt also stated 'Here's a paraphrased version of the summary, using different wording and sentence structure while retaining all original information', which means the provided text is NOT the summary to be evaluated, but rather an instruction about how to format the summary to be evaluated. Since I was provided with the summary directly, and not asked to paraphrase it, this prompt following score is based on the summary I received."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the main findings and conclusions of the paper, including the observed improvements in motor function and engagement, the focus on upper limbs and clinical settings, the lack of AR studies, and the call for more home-based research and customized games. These are the most critical take-home messages."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the original paper. There are no unsupported or fabricated statements."
  },
  "total_score": 49,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary effectively captures the essence of the research paper, accurately presenting the methodology, key findings, and conclusions within the requested sentence limit. Its strengths lie in its factual accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the paper's core message, though some technical terms are used without explicit definition."
