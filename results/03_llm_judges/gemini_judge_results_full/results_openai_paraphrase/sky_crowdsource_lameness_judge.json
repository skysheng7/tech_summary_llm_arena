    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the research question by stating the study's aim: investigating a remote, comparative approach for evaluating lameness in dairy cows and assessing its scalability and agreement with expert evaluations."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical results and key findings, such as the scale (-3 to +3), the number of assignments and video pairs, the ICC values (0.89 to 0.91, >0.80), and the suggested number of workers (10), are accurately reflected from the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'comparative approach', 'lameness specialists', and 'intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC)' which are understandable in context. While 'ICC' is not explicitly defined, its meaning is clear from its application in measuring agreement. The summary flows well and is easy to comprehend."
