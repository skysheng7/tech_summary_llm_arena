  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the paper's core contribution: developing a rapid heuristic for identifying communities in massive networks by optimizing modularity."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All stated facts, including the two-step iterative process, the basis of efficiency, the comparison of performance (speed and modularity), and the application to the Belgian mobile-phone network, are accurately reflected in the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses key terms like 'modularity,' 'communities,' and 'meta-network' appropriately. While 'modularity' itself isn't deeply explained, it's presented in context of 'maximizing modularity' and 'modularity scores,' which is sufficient for a summary of this length. The explanation of the iterative process is coherent."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, precisely matching the prompt's requirement."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the main contributions: the algorithm's novelty (speed for massive networks), its core mechanism (modularity optimization, two phases), its performance advantages (speed, modularity), and a key validation example (Belgian mobile-phone network). It also mentions the multi-resolution aspect."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary, including the description of the algorithm, its performance, and its application, are directly supported by the content of the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that accurately and concisely captures the essence of the research paper. It adheres perfectly to the prompt's sentence limit and effectively communicates the algorithm's novelty, methodology, performance benefits, and a key application. The terminology used is appropriate for the context."
