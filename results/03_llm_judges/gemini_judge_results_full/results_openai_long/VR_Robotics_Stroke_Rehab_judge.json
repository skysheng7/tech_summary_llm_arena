  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the research question, which is to investigate the effectiveness and safety of VR-based robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation in stroke patients with hemiplegia."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical results, including FMA-LE scores (6.5 vs 3.3), p-values (<0.001, <0.05, 0.873), and sample sizes (42 enrolled, 40 completed, 20 per group), are accurately reported from the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary generally uses clear language. While it mentions terms like 'hemiplegia', 'FMA-LE', 'BBS', 'FAC', 'BI', 'SS-QoL', and 'MoCA', it provides brief explanations for most (e.g., 'paralysis or weakness on one side of the body' for hemiplegia) or uses them in a context that makes their meaning clear. The term 'assessor-blinded' is used without explicit explanation, which could be a minor point of confusion for a lay reader."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is significantly longer, containing multiple paragraphs and well over 5 sentences."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively covers the key aspects of the paper: the study design, the interventions, the primary and secondary outcomes, the cognitive function findings, the safety results, and the overall conclusion and recommendations for future research. It highlights the significant improvements in motor function, balance, walking, ADL, and quality of life, while noting the non-significant finding for cognitive function."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 49,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary provides a comprehensive and factually accurate overview of the research paper, covering its methodology, results, and conclusions with excellent detail. However, it significantly fails to adhere to the prompt's instruction of providing a 5-sentence summary, making it overly verbose."
