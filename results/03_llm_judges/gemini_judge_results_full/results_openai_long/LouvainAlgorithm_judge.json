  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the research question: to propose a fast heuristic method for identifying communities in large networks based on modularity optimization."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately describes the two-phase iterative process, the modularity metric, the speed advantages due to efficient calculations and network shrinkage, and the experimental validation on a Belgian mobile phone network."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Key terms like 'modularity', 'communities', 'heuristic', 'meta-network', and 'multi-resolution' are used. 'Modularity' is explained as a metric. 'Meta-network' and 'multi-resolution' are explained through context. However, the term 'local maxima' from the paper is not explicitly explained in the summary, though the idea of 'enhancement of the overall modularity score' conveys a similar concept. The summary is generally coherent."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The original prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is significantly longer, exceeding 5 sentences and structured into multiple paragraphs, indicating a complete failure to follow the prompt's length constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most important aspects of the paper: the proposed method, its core mechanism (modularity optimization, two phases), its key advantage (speed for large networks), and its validation through experimental results, including a real-world example with meaningful findings (language communities)."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the original paper. No external information or unsupported claims are introduced."
  },
  "total_score": 48,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary provides a comprehensive and accurate overview of the paper's methodology, advantages, and experimental validation. Its main weakness is its complete disregard for the prompt's sentence limit, resulting in a significantly longer output than requested."
