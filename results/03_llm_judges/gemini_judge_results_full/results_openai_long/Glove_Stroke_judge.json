  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the central research question in the first sentence: 'whether the use of wearable robotic gloves can lead to enhancements in hand function among individuals who have experienced a stroke.'"
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the number of studies included (5), the search date (September 2021), the total number of records initially identified (2674), the sample size range (3-13), the types of devices, the general intervention approaches (task-oriented, game-based, VR), the duration (4-6 weeks), and the quality assessment scores (7-10/12 using Downs and Black). The only minor inaccuracy is the phrasing 'five included studies were characterized by their limited participant numbers', when the paper states '4 records were selected based on full text and 1 study was selected based on reference checking', making it 5 studies. The summary does not state this correctly. The description of the intervention duration as 'three times per week' and '180 and 270 minutes per week' is omitted, which is a slight loss of detail but not a factual error."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary explains terms like 'chronic phase' and 'subacute phase' of stroke. It also clearly describes the function of the robotic gloves (finger extension, gripping, functional tasks) and the intervention methods (task-oriented practice, game-based exercises, virtual reality simulations). The language is accessible and coherent."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt specifically requested a summary in '5 sentences'. The provided summary is significantly longer, spanning multiple paragraphs and far exceeding the 5-sentence limit. It reads more like an abstract or an expanded summary."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the key aspects of the paper: the research question, methodology (search strategy, databases, inclusion/exclusion), results (number of studies, sample size, findings of improvements), devices used, intervention types and duration, quality assessment, and the main limitations and conclusions. It captures the essential take-home messages."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All information presented in the summary appears to be directly supported by the text of the original research paper. No unsupported claims or fabricated information were identified."
  },
  "total_score": 49,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary excels in its research question clarity, factual accuracy, and comprehensive coverage of the paper's content and its relevance. However, it completely fails to adhere to the prompt's specific sentence count requirement, providing a much longer and more detailed response than requested."
