{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the main research question: to define a strategy (closed testing procedure) for selecting the appropriate method for updating prediction models when applied to new populations."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the methods (recalibration, recalibration in the large, model revision), the goal (balancing update need with overfitting risk), and the validation approach (clinical examples) described in the paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Terms like 'closed testing procedure,' 'recalibration in the large,' 'recalibration,' and 'model revision' are used and their context implies their meaning. The concept of 'overfitting' is also mentioned. The summary is coherent and easy to follow, though a slightly deeper explanation of the updating methods might improve it further."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary. All provided paraphrases are exactly 5 sentences long."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively covers the core contribution of the paper: the proposed closed testing procedure for model updating, its rationale (balancing update need and overfitting risk), its progressive nature, and its application in clinical examples."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summaries are directly supported by the content of the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 53,
  "overall_assessment": "The summaries accurately capture the essence of the research paper, clearly stating the problem, the proposed solution (closed testing procedure), and its benefits, while adhering to the sentence count requested by the prompt. The explanation of technical terms is sufficient for the context, making the summaries highly relevant and factually correct."
