  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the main research goal, which is to introduce and validate a new technique for lameness assessment in dairy cattle using a crowd-sourced, pairwise comparison approach to build a lameness hierarchy."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings of the paper, including the use of pairwise comparisons, crowd-sourcing, strong agreement among evaluators, effectiveness with untrained workers, the efficiency of the subsampling algorithm, and the potential for broader applications."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'lameness hierarchy,' 'pairwise comparison,' and 'subsampling algorithm.' While the context helps, a brief explanation of 'pairwise comparison' (i.e., comparing two cows at a time) could improve clarity for a general audience. However, the overall coherence is good."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, adhering perfectly to the prompt's request."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the most crucial aspects of the paper: the novel method, its validation with experts and crowd workers, the efficiency gains through subsampling, its superiority over traditional methods, and its potential for wider application. These are the key takeaways."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the research paper. There are no unsupported claims or fabricated information."
  },
  "total_score": 58,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary effectively captures the essence of the research paper, clearly articulating the novel lameness assessment method, its validation, and its implications. It adheres strictly to the sentence limit and maintains factual accuracy and relevance, making it a strong representation of the original work."
