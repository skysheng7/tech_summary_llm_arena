{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All versions clearly articulate the research question, which is to investigate the use of exoskeletons combined with VR, AR, or gamification for stroke rehabilitation."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summaries accurately reflect the key findings of the paper, including the focus on upper limb rehabilitation, the gap in lower limb and home-based research, and the potential of these technologies."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summaries use technical terms like VR, AR, and gamification, which are central to the paper's topic. While not explicitly defined within the summaries, their context within the rehabilitation of stroke patients makes them generally understandable to someone familiar with the field. Version 3 is slightly less explanatory due to its conciseness."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All four versions provided are exactly 5 sentences long, directly fulfilling the prompt's instruction."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summaries effectively capture the most important takeaways: the integration of exoskeletons with VR/AR/gamification, the observed benefits (motor function, engagement), the identified gaps (lower limb, home-based), and the future directions (customizable games, AR exploration). All versions are highly relevant to the paper's core message."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summaries are directly supported by the content of the original paper. No unsupported claims or fabrications were found."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "These summaries are excellent, accurately reflecting the paper's research question, findings, and limitations within the requested sentence count. They are factually sound, relevant, and avoid any hallucinations, demonstrating a strong understanding of the original article."
