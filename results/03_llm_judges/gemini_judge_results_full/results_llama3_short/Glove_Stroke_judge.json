  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the core research question of the article, which is to investigate the therapeutic effects of wearable robotic gloves on hand function in stroke patients."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the findings regarding the benefits of robotic gloves (increased movement, strength, reduced spasticity) and the limitations (limited long-term evidence, need for more research). It also correctly mentions the call for standardization of outcome measures and methodological quality. The statement about reducing spasticity is slightly nuanced in the paper, as it mentions the gloves were used for patients with low spasticity and the effects on higher spasticity are unknown, but the summary's general statement is broadly supported."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses clear and understandable language. While it mentions terms like 'spasticity' and 'outcome measures,' these are general terms that are well-understood in the context of medical research and do not require explicit explanation for a general audience or within this summary's scope."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, fulfilling the prompt's requirement."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the main takeaways: the potential benefits of robotic gloves, the need for more research due to limitations in current studies (evidence level, sample size, standardization), and the call for future research. It covers the key conclusions and recommendations."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements in the summary are directly supported by the content of the research paper. There are no claims made that are not present in the original text."
  },
  "total_score": 57,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary effectively captures the essence of the research article within the requested sentence limit. It accurately reflects the study's findings on the benefits of robotic gloves for stroke patients, while also highlighting the limitations and future research needs identified by the authors."
