  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the research question, which is to systematically review exoskeletons combined with VR, AR, and gamification for stroke rehabilitation and assess their effectiveness."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the general findings of the paper regarding positive outcomes in motor function and the discussion of limitations. However, it slightly overstates the mention of improved cognitive function, which was not a primary focus or consistently reported outcome in the paper. The paper did mention improvements in activity and participation as objectives, but the results section focused more on motor function and engagement. It correctly identifies common limitations such as small sample sizes and variability in outcome measures."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses relevant terminology (exoskeletons, VR, AR, gamification, stroke rehabilitation) that is contextually appropriate and generally understood within the field. It maintains coherence and is easy to follow."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, as requested by the prompt."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the main objectives, general findings, and limitations of the review. It successfully highlights the potential of the technologies and the need for further research. It could be slightly more specific about the primary focus on motor function rather than broadly including cognitive function, which was less emphasized in the results."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary makes a minor claim about improved cognitive function being a result, which is not strongly supported in the 'Results' section of the paper. While the objective mentioned 'activity and participation', the reported results predominantly focused on motor function and engagement. The rest of the summary is well-supported by the text."
  },
  "total_score": 54,
  "overall_assessment": "This is a good summary that accurately captures the core of the research paper, its objectives, general findings, and limitations. It follows the prompt's length constraint perfectly. The only minor drawback is a slight overemphasis on cognitive function improvements, which were not as prominently highlighted in the original paper's results as motor function and engagement."
