{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately captures the essence of the research questions posed in the paper, which are related to how DHTs are used in stroke rehabilitation in Canada, the gaps in their current use, and how findings can inform future decisions."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary states that '61 research papers were conducted' and 'The article presents a comprehensive analysis of 61 studies'. However, the original paper clearly states in the Abstract and Results sections that only 14 studies were included in the review. This is a significant factual inaccuracy regarding the scope of the review."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'telerehabilitation', 'virtual reality systems', and 'gaming' which are generally understandable in context. It avoids overly technical jargon and maintains a coherent flow."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The provided summary (regardless of the version) consists of exactly 5 sentences, directly adhering to the prompt's request."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary touches on the promise of DHTs, the expansion of access, and the persistent obstacles, which are key takeaways. However, by misrepresenting the number of studies and not specifying the Canadian context, it loses some relevance and completeness compared to what a 5-sentence summary of the *actual* paper could achieve."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The primary hallucination is the number of studies included (61 instead of 14). While the summary mentions 'patient recovery' and 'broadening access', it does not explicitly mention the Canadian context, which was a key focus of the original paper. The prompt was 'Can you provide a summary of this article in 5 sentences?' and the provided summaries do not mention Canada or the specific focus on Canada."
  },
  "total_score": 33,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary successfully adheres to the 5-sentence limit and uses coherent language. However, it contains a major factual inaccuracy regarding the number of studies reviewed (stating 61 instead of the actual 14) and omits the specific Canadian context of the research, which diminishes its accuracy and relevance."
