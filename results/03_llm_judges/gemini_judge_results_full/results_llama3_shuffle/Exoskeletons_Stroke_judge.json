  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the main research question, which is to review the effectiveness of exoskeletons combined with VR, AR, and gamification for stroke rehabilitation."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the core findings regarding positive outcomes in motor function and general mention of cognitive function and engagement. However, it doesn't specify that the review focused on motor function improvements as the primary outcome. The summary also accurately mentions limitations such as small sample sizes and variability in outcome measures."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses key terminologies (exoskeletons, VR, AR, gamification, stroke rehabilitation) directly from the paper and presents them coherently within the context of the research. No additional explanation was needed as the terms are standard in the field and their application is clear."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, adhering perfectly to the prompt's constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the essence of the paper: the research question, the technologies reviewed, the general findings (positive motor function outcomes, improved engagement), the limitations, and the call for future research. It prioritizes the most crucial takeaways."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the research paper. There are no unsupported claims or fabrications."
  },
  "total_score": 55,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent, accurately reflecting the paper's research question, findings, and limitations within the requested sentence count. It successfully captures the core contributions of the systematic review, demonstrating strong factual accuracy and coherence."
