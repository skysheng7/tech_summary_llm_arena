  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the core research question, which is to propose and validate a novel method for dairy cow lameness assessment using crowd-sourced pairwise comparisons to construct a lameness hierarchy."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key numerical findings presented in the paper, including the ICC values for traditional gait scoring (0.44-0.62) and the proposed pairwise method (0.81 and 0.85), as well as the efficiency metrics (8 crowd workers, 37% of comparisons)."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses technical terms like 'lameness hierarchy', 'pairwise comparisons', 'gait scoring', and 'ICC' which are central to the paper. While these terms are not explicitly defined, their meaning is inferable from the context of lameness assessment and comparison. The overall coherence is good."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, precisely following the prompt's instruction."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the most important contributions of the paper: the inadequacy of traditional methods, the proposed novel method, its feasibility with crowd workers, its efficiency, and its potential applications for training automated detection systems."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the original research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent, accurately capturing the research question, methodology, key findings, and implications within the requested sentence limit. It concisely communicates the paper's contribution to improving lameness assessment in dairy cows."
