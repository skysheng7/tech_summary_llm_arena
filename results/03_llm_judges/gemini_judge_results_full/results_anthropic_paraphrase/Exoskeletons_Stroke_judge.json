  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the research question as exploring the application of exoskeletons with VR, AR, or gamification for stroke survivors' recovery and assessing the effectiveness and trends."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key numerical data from the paper, including the number of studies (30), publication years (2010-2017), participant numbers (approx. 385), limb focus (28 upper limb), specific devices, and settings (25 clinic vs 4 home)."
