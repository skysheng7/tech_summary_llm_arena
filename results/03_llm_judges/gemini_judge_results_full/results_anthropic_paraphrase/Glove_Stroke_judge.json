  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the research question of the systematic review, which is to evaluate the therapeutic effects of wearable robotic gloves on improving hand function in stroke patients."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key numerical findings from the paper, including the number of studies included (5), the range of participants (3-13), the quality scores (7-10 out of 12), and the intervention duration (4-6 weeks). It also correctly names the five robotic glove technologies mentioned."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate terminology related to the field, such as 'systematic review,' 'motor skills,' 'stroke,' 'randomized controlled trials,' and specific device names. While terms like 'muscle stiffness' and 'methodological rigor' are understandable in context, a brief explanation of what constitutes 'methodological rigor' in this context could have further enhanced clarity. However, overall, the summary is coherent and easy to understand."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, precisely adhering to the prompt's instruction."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively covers the most crucial aspects of the paper: the objective, the methodology's outcome (limited studies), the main findings (positive effects), the significant limitations (sample size, RCT absence, chronic phase focus, quality scores), the specific devices and intervention details, and the concluding recommendation for future research. It captures the essence of the study's contribution."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the information presented in the original paper."
  },
  "total_score": 58,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary effectively addresses the prompt, providing a concise and accurate overview of the systematic review. It highlights the key findings, limitations, and future research directions, while strictly adhering to the requested sentence count. The clarity of its language and factual accuracy make it a high-quality summary."
