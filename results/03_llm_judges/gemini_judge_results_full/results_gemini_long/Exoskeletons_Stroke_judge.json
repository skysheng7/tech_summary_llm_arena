{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the core research question, which is to investigate the effectiveness of combining exoskeletons with VR, AR, or gamification for stroke rehabilitation and to identify trends and gaps."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings of the paper, including the promise of combined technologies for motor function and engagement, the focus on upper limb rehabilitation, the lack of lower limb and home-based research, and the need for adaptable games and AR exploration."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like VR, AR, and gamification appropriately within the context of stroke rehabilitation. The flow is coherent and easy to understand, explaining the purpose of these technologies without requiring external knowledge."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The original prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is significantly longer, exceeding the requested sentence count by a large margin. It is more of a detailed abstract than a 5-sentence summary."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the most important take-home messages: the effectiveness of combined technologies, the focus on upper limbs, the research gaps (lower limb, home-based), the need for adaptable games and AR, and the challenges of transitioning to home settings."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the original paper."
  },
  "total_score": 50,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary provides a highly accurate and comprehensive overview of the paper's findings, research gaps, and conclusions. However, it completely failed to adhere to the sentence limit requested in the prompt, delivering an extended summary instead of a concise five-sentence one."
