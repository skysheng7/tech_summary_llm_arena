  "research_question": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research question by explaining that the review explored how DHTs are used for stroke rehabilitation in Canada and identified gaps and future directions. It implicitly addresses the 'how', 'gaps', and 'future directions' aspects."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings of the paper, including the number of studies reviewed (14), the primary focus on upper extremity and chronic phase, the types of technologies used (VR, gaming, mobile/sensor), the feasibility and effectiveness of DHTs, and the identified barriers (technical, user inexperience, clinician involvement)."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'Digital Health Technologies (DHTs)' and 'scoping review' and implicitly explains their purpose within the context of the review. It also mentions 'Virtual Reality (VR)', 'gaming systems', and 'mobile applications' which are common terms. The flow is logical and easy to follow."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The original prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is significantly longer, consisting of 6 paragraphs and well over 5 sentences. This is a major deviation from the prompt's instructions."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively covers the most important take-home messages from the paper: the scope of the review, the findings on technology use, effectiveness, feasibility, barriers, and recommendations for future research. It accurately reflects the paper's main contributions."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the original research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 47,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is comprehensive and accurately captures the key findings and implications of the research paper. It effectively explains the scope, methodologies, results, and conclusions. However, it fails to adhere to the prompt's explicit instruction to provide a 5-sentence summary, making it too long."
