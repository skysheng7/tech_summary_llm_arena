"authors": ["Blondel et al."],
"abstract": "This paper by Blondel et al. introduces a fast, heuristic algorithm for detecting community structure in large networks through modularity optimization.",
"methodology": "The method works in two iterative phases: first optimizing modularity by moving individual nodes between communities, then aggregating communities into meta-networks for subsequent passes.",
"results": "The algorithm demonstrates exceptional computational efficiency, analyzing networks up to 118 million nodes in just 152 minutes, vastly outperforming previous methods limited to networks under 5 million nodes.",
"validation": "The approach naturally reveals hierarchical community structure at multiple resolutions and was validated on a Belgian mobile phone network of 2.6 million users, successfully identifying linguistically homogeneous communities separated by French and Dutch speakers.",
"evaluation": {
"speed": "linear complexity on sparse networks",
"modularity": "superior speed (linear complexity on sparse networks) and higher modularity values compared to existing community detection methods"
