Here is a summary of the article in 5 sentences:

The article discusses a quantum process that can be used to simulate the behavior of a large system by entangling many smaller systems. This process involves applying a sequence of linear maps, or quantum gates, to the input states. The article provides a mathematical framework for understanding how these quantum gates can be combined to achieve specific goals, such as creating a maximally entangled state or simulating the behavior of a complex system. The authors also discuss some of the limitations and challenges associated with using this process to simulate complex systems. Overall, the article provides a valuable contribution to our understanding of the capabilities and limitations of quantum processing techniques.
