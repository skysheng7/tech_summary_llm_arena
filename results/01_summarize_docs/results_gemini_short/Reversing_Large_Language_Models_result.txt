This paper introduces memory-efficient, reversible architectures for Large Language Models (LLMs) inspired by physics. These architectures reduce memory consumption by reconstructing intermediate activations during backpropagation, allowing for larger batch sizes and improved training throughput. The authors also propose a method to convert existing non-reversible LLMs into reversible ones through fine-tuning, making the approach practical. Experiments show that these reversible models achieve comparable or better performance than standard LLMs while significantly reducing memory requirements. This work offers a scalable path towards more efficient LLM training and fine-tuning, especially in resource-constrained environments.
