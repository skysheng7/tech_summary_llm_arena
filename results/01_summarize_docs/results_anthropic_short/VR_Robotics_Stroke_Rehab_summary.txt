# Summary of the Study

This pilot randomized controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR)-based robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation in 42 stroke patients with hemiplegia in Shanghai, China. The intervention group (n=20) received VR-based robotic training plus conventional rehabilitation for 30 minutes daily, 5 days/week for 4 weeks, while the control group (n=20) received only conventional rehabilitation. Results showed the intervention group had significantly greater improvements in lower limb motor function (mean difference 6.5 vs 3.3), balance, walking ability, activities of daily living, and quality of life compared to controls, though cognitive function improvements were similar between groups. No adverse events occurred during the trial, demonstrating the safety and feasibility of this approach. The study provides preliminary evidence supporting VR-based robotic training as a promising adjunct therapy for stroke rehabilitation, though larger studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm these findings.
