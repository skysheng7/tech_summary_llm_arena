This scoping review examined how digital health technologies (DHTs) have been used for stroke rehabilitation in Canada and what gaps remain for clinical, research, and policy decision-making. Using database and grey-literature searches, the authors identified 14 Canadian studies published between 2010 and 2022, including qualitative studies and randomized controlled trials. Most studies targeted people in the chronic phase of stroke and focused primarily on upper-extremity rehabilitation, delivered mainly at home or in institutions. The technologies studied most often included sensors/mobile tools, virtual reality and telerehabilitation (including exergames), gaming systems, and—less frequently—robotic devices, with many studies reporting feasibility, good engagement, and functional improvements but also barriers like technical issues, usability, and access/training constraints. The authors conclude that DHTs are promising for improving stroke rehabilitation in Canada, but more rigorous trials and broader outcome coverage (e.g., cognition, lower extremity function, ADLs, mental health, and earlier stroke phases) are needed to support equitable implementation.
