DeBERTNeXT is a multimodal fake news detection framework that classifies news as real or fake by jointly using an article’s text and its accompanying image. It extracts text representations with the DeBERTa V3 transformer and image representations with a ConvNeXT Large model, then concatenates these features and applies a final sigmoid classifier. The authors train and evaluate the model on the large Fakeddit dataset and the smaller Politifact and Gossipcop benchmarks, using transfer learning and a consistent preprocessing pipeline for images and tokenized text. DeBERTNeXT achieves higher performance than prior multimodal baselines, improving accuracy by about 3.8% on Fakeddit, 2.1% on Politifact, and 1.0% on Gossipcop. The paper concludes that combining stronger modern backbones for language and vision yields more effective multimodal fake news detection, and suggests extending the approach to additional modalities like audio and video.
