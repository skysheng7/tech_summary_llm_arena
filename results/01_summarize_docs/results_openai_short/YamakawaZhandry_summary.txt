Yamakawa and Zhandry show that, relative to a uniformly random oracle, there are NP *search* problems that quantum polynomial-time algorithms can solve but any classical probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm (even computationally unbounded but limited to polynomially many *classical* oracle queries) cannot.  They build a *publicly verifiable* proof of quantumness with essentially minimal interaction: non-interactive for uniform adversaries and two-message public-coin for non-uniform (oracle-dependent advice) adversaries.  Using the same ideas, they construct cryptographic separations where certain primitives (including one-way functions and even collision-resistant hash functions) are secure against classical query-bounded attackers but become easy to invert for quantum attackers, with further counterexamples for signatures and CPA-secure public-key encryption (the latter assuming a classically CPA-secure scheme exists).  The constructions rely on combining random-oracle outputs with strong error-correcting code properties (list recoverability) to make classical inversion infeasible, while a quantum Fourier-transform–based procedure efficiently samples preimages.  They argue these results do not contradict the Aaronson–Ambainis conjecture (which concerns decision problems), and assuming it they also obtain minimally interactive, publicly verifiable “certifiable randomness” protocols; replacing the random oracle with a concrete hash like SHA-2 yields plausible “Minicrypt-style” instantiations without heavy algebraic structure.
