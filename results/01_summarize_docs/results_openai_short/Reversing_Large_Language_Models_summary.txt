The article introduces memory‑efficient reversible architectures for large language models (LLMs) that avoid storing intermediate activations by reconstructing hidden states during backpropagation using time‑reversible dynamics inspired by differential equations. It presents three reversible update schemes—midpoint, leapfrog (wave‑equation/second‑order), and Hamiltonian/symplectic dynamics—and analyzes when such methods are stable in both forward and backward directions. Because activation memory becomes (approximately) constant with depth, these models can train with much larger batch sizes (reported around 10× larger on several GPUs), often improving throughput despite some extra recomputation. The paper also proposes a practical “retrofit” method to convert existing pretrained, non‑reversible transformers into reversible ones via an approximation plus a short fine‑tuning procedure that aligns outputs to the original model. Experiments on GPT‑2 (small/large) and conversions of TinyLlama and SmolLM2 show comparable or sometimes slightly better loss and zero‑shot benchmark performance while substantially reducing memory use.
