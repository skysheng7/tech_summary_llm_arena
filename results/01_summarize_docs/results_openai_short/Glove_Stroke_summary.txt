This systematic review examined whether wearable robotic gloves improve hand function in people after stroke by searching major databases up to September 2021. Out of 2674 records, only five small studies (3–13 participants; mostly chronic or subacute stroke) met inclusion criteria, and all reported improvements in hand/upper-limb outcomes after glove-based training. The reviewed devices (EPHO, PneuGlove, X-Glove, HandinMind, and IronHand) generally targeted finger extension or grip/task performance, using task-oriented practice and/or game/virtual-reality exercises over 4–6 weeks. Methodological quality was moderate (7–10/12 on an adapted Downs and Black checklist), but there were no randomized controlled trials, no control groups, and limited sample sizes and participant characterization (e.g., spasticity severity). The authors conclude that while results are promising, there is no standardized intervention approach or timing, and larger, higher-quality comparative studies are needed to confirm therapeutic effectiveness.
