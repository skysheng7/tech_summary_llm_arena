Here is a summary of the article in 5 sentences:

The study investigates the use of crowdsourcing and machine learning algorithms to assess lameness in dairy cattle. The researchers developed a web-based platform that allowed participants to watch videos of cows and rate their lameness based on predefined criteria. They found that while individual raters had low accuracy, aggregating ratings from a large number of people resulted in high accuracy. This approach can be used to develop a robust and scalable system for detecting lameness in dairy cattle, which is an important welfare issue. The study also highlights the potential applications of crowdsourcing and machine learning in animal welfare assessments.
