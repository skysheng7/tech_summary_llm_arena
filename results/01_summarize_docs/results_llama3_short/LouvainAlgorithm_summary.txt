Here is a summary of the article in 5 sentences:

The paper discusses a new algorithm for community detection in large networks, which is able to unfold hierarchical community structures. The algorithm, called the "CNM" (Community Detection Algorithm), uses a two-phase approach: first, it aggregates nodes into communities based on their connections, and then it refines these communities by iteratively merging or splitting them to maximize modularity. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by applying it to several networks, including a social network and an Erdős-Rényi random graph. They also show that the algorithm is able to identify hierarchical community structures, which are common in many complex networks. Overall, the CNM algorithm provides a fast and efficient way to detect communities in large networks, with good accuracy and scalability.
