  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the overarching research question by stating the review's aim: to examine how DHTs have been employed for stroke recovery in Canada, identifying technologies, findings, and future directions."

    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings from the paper, including the number of studies reviewed (14), the focus on upper limb function and chronic stage, the types of technologies used, the feasibility/effectiveness of DHTs, the identified barriers and facilitators, and the future research recommendations."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is coherent and easy to understand. It uses terms like 'digital health technologies (DHTs)' which are defined implicitly by the context of the paper. Other terms like 'virtual reality,' 'gaming consoles,' and 'mobile or sensor-driven exercises' are common and understandable. The conclusion about 'robust randomized controlled trials' is also presented clearly."
