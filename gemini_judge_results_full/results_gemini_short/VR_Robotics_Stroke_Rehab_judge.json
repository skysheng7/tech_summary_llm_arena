  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the research question, which is to investigate the effectiveness of VR-based robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation in stroke patients with hemiplegia."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All the stated findings, including the significant improvements in motor function, balance, walking ability, ADLs, and quality of life, as well as the non-significant improvement in cognitive function, are accurately reflected from the paper. The conclusion about the promise and feasibility of the approach is also correctly stated."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses clear and understandable language. While terms like 'hemiplegia' and 'VR-based robotic training' are used, they are presented in a context that makes their meaning apparent without explicit definition, maintaining coherence."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, perfectly matching the prompt's requirement."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the most crucial takeaways from the paper: the study's objective, the key positive findings (motor function, balance, walking, ADLs, QoL), the nuanced finding about cognitive function, and the overall conclusion regarding feasibility and the need for further research."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the information presented in the research paper. There are no unsupported claims or fabrications."
  },
  "total_score": 60,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that perfectly adheres to the prompt's constraints. It accurately and concisely conveys the core findings and conclusions of the research paper, demonstrating a strong understanding of the material."
