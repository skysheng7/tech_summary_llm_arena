  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core research question of the paper: proposing and validating a novel method for lameness assessment using pairwise comparisons and crowd-sourcing to construct a lameness hierarchy, as an alternative to traditional gait scoring."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical values and reliability metrics (ICC scores, percentage reduction in comparisons) mentioned in the summary are accurately reported from the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses some technical terms like 'pairwise comparison', 'lameness hierarchy', 'EloSteepness', and 'ICC'. While 'ICC' is mentioned in the context of reliability, the others are reasonably clear from the context. It explains the concept of a 'lameness hierarchy' well. A slightly deeper explanation of EloSteepness might be beneficial but it's understandable in the context of a summary."

  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary has 5 sentences."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the key aspects: the proposed method, its comparison to traditional methods, the use of crowd-sourcing, the developed algorithm for efficiency, and the overall conclusion about its utility for training automated models. It highlights the most important findings and contributions."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the information presented in the original research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 54,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is excellent, accurately capturing the research question, methods, key findings, and conclusions of the paper. It adheres to the sentence limit and provides a comprehensive yet concise overview of the study's contributions."
