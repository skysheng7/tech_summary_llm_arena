  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly states the research question: to develop and validate a model to predict the risk of a first severe COPD exacerbation."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical values and key findings, such as the sample size (219,015), prediction timelines (5-year and 12-month), c-statistics (0.836 and 0.756), and the number of core/optional predictors (4 and 28), are accurately reflected from the paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'COPD exacerbation', 'CPRD Aurum', 'MRC dyspnoea score', 'FEV₁', 'c-statistic', and 'net benefit'. While most are standard in this field, they are used in a context that makes their meaning inferable, especially with the overall coherence of the summary. Minimal explanation is needed for this target audience."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary consists of exactly 5 sentences as requested in the prompt."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core aspects of the paper: the model's purpose, the data used, key predictors, performance metrics (discrimination and calibration), and the main conclusion regarding clinical utility and future steps. It highlights the most important take-home messages."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the provided research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that accurately and concisely captures the essential findings of the research paper. It adheres strictly to the prompt's sentence limit and effectively communicates the model's purpose, performance, and implications."
