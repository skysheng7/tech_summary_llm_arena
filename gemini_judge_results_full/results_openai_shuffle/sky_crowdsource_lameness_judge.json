  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the core research question: to test a remote, comparison-based method for assessing dairy cow lameness using crowd workers."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical results (e.g., -3 to +3 scale, 11 tasks, 10 video pairs, 50 workers, 5 expert assessors, 88 test comparisons, ICC values, 10 workers for strong agreement) and qualitative findings (moderate agreement among crowd workers, high agreement between crowd averages and experts, minimal improvement with filtering/clustering) are accurately reflected from the paper."

  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essential elements: the method, the participants, the key findings (agreement levels, impact of worker numbers, effect of filtering), and the main conclusions and implications (fast, low-cost method, data generation for AI)."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the research paper."
