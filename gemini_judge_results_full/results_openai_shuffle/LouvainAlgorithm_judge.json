{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the core research question, which is to develop a fast and effective method for detecting communities in large networks."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the method proposed (modularity optimization through local moves and aggregation), its performance characteristics (fast, scalable), and its application results (Belgian mobile phone network)."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "Key terms like 'modularity optimization,' 'meta-network,' and 'hierarchy of communities' are used in context and are understandable. The explanation of the algorithm's steps (local moves, aggregation) is coherent and clear."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, adhering precisely to the prompt's requirement."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the most important aspects: the novel algorithm, its speed and scalability advantages, its performance compared to existing methods, and a key application demonstrating its utility and ability to reveal hierarchical structure."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary, such as the algorithm's speed, its effectiveness in modularity optimization, and its application to the Belgian mobile-phone network, are directly supported by the content of the paper."
  },
  "total_score": 60,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that precisely follows the prompt. It accurately captures the research question, method, performance, and key findings of the paper in a concise and coherent manner, using appropriate terminology."
