  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the research question, which is to examine the effectiveness of exoskeletons combined with VR, AR, or gamification for poststroke rehabilitation."
  },

    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses relevant technical terms like 'exoskeleton', 'VR', 'AR', and 'gamification' which are core to the paper's topic. These terms are used in a coherent and understandable context within the summary, and no complex jargon is introduced without it being clear from the context. The abbreviations used in the paper (like PRISMA, WMFT, MAS) are either explained in the summary or their context makes them understandable."
