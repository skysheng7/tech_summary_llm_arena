{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question: developing a fast and efficient method for detecting communities in large networks."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All points presented in the summary are directly supported by the paper, including the description of the algorithm's two phases, its speed, its performance on various networks, and the specific example of the Belgian mobile phone network."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'modularity,' 'communities,' and 'meta-network' which are central to the paper. While not explicitly defined, their context within the description of the algorithm makes them reasonably understandable for someone familiar with network analysis. The bullet point format aids coherence."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is in a bulleted list format and contains significantly more than 5 distinct points, failing to adhere to the sentence constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the main contributions of the paper: the novel algorithm, its speed and scalability, its effectiveness in finding communities, and its application to a real-world dataset, highlighting its practical relevance and hierarchical nature."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements in the summary are directly supported by the content of the provided paper."
  },
  "total_score": 48,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is excellent in terms of content, accurately reflecting the paper's key findings, methodology, and applications. However, it completely fails to adhere to the prompt's request for a 5-sentence summary, instead presenting a detailed bulleted list."
