{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the central research question about whether dominance hierarchies change with competition intensity in dairy cows and how this is measured."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical data and descriptions of findings (e.g., hierarchy steepness decrease, increase in two-way dyads, decline in dominant cow's win rate) are accurately reflected from the paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Terms like 'replacement events', 'feeder occupancy', 'Elo-based hierarchies', 'hierarchy steepness', and 'two-way dyads' are used and understandable within the context of the summary. While 'Elo' is not explicitly explained, its context as a basis for hierarchy calculation is clear. The summary is coherent and easy to follow."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The original prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is presented as a list of bullet points, totaling 10 distinct points, failing to adhere to the sentence count constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the most crucial findings: the flattening of the hierarchy with increased competition, the increase in two-way dyads, the shift in dominance dynamics at high competition, and the key conclusion that resource valuation can override intrinsic dominance. The methodological approach is also briefly mentioned for context."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the information presented in the research paper. No external or unsupported claims are made."
  },
  "total_score": 48,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent in its content, accurately reflecting the study's methodology, findings, and conclusions with factual precision. However, it completely failed to adhere to the prompt's request for a 5-sentence summary, presenting the information as a list of 10 bullet points instead."
