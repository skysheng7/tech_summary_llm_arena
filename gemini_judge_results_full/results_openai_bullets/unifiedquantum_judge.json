  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the paper's main research goal: to unify various quantum 'no-go' theorems (no-cloning, no-deleting, no-superposing) and to present general principles and schemes for quantum transformations."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All points presented in the summary are directly supported by the content of the paper. The descriptions of the theorems, schemes, and their conditions (e.g., linear independence) are accurate."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses technical terms like 'no-go theorems', 'superposition principle', 'no-cloning', 'no-deleting', 'no-superposing', 'no-encoding', 'completely positive map', 'finite dimensions', 'linear independence', 'matrix-norm/metric inequalities', and 'probabilistic cloning'. While these are central to the paper, the summary does not explicitly define them. However, their context within the paper's aims (unifying theorems, presenting schemes) allows for reasonable coherence for someone with a background in the field. A slightly higher score would be given if some basic terms were briefly explained."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary. The provided output is in bullet point format and contains 8 distinct points, significantly deviating from the requested sentence count and format."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively covers all the key contributions: the unified 'no-go' perspective, the new 'no-encoding' theorem and its implications, the one-shot framework for cloning/deleting, the characterization via linear independence, the derivation of bounds, and the constructive protocols for superposition. It captures the most important take-home messages."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the provided paper. No external information or unsupported claims are present."
  },
  "total_score": 48,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is excellent in its content, accurately reflecting the paper's core research questions, findings, and contributions. It is comprehensive and factually sound. However, it fails to adhere to the prompt's constraint of providing a 5-sentence summary, presenting the information as a list of 8 bullet points instead."
