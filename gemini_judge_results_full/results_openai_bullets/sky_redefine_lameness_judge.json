{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the core research question of proposing and evaluating a new method for lameness assessment in dairy cows."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical results (ICC values, percentage reduction in comparisons) and key findings are accurately represented from the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Key terms like 'lameness hierarchy,' 'pairwise comparison,' and 'EloSteepness' are introduced, but their technical details (e.g., Bayesian Elo-based method) are not fully explained, which is understandable given the sentence constraint. Coherence is good, presenting a logical flow of the paper's methodology and findings."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is a list of bullet points, containing significantly more than 5 distinct statements of information."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the most critical contributions: the proposed method, its superiority over traditional methods, the feasibility with crowd workers, the subsampling algorithm, and its implications for automated detection."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All points presented in the summary are directly supported by information found within the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 48,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary provides a comprehensive and factually accurate overview of the paper's findings, effectively covering the most relevant points. However, it fails to adhere to the prompt's constraint of a 5-sentence summary, instead presenting a detailed bulleted list."
