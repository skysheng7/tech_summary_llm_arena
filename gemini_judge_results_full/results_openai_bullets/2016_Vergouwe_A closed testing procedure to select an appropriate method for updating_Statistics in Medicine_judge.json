{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the core research question: developing and evaluating a closed testing procedure to select the appropriate method for updating prediction models."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the methods (closed testing procedure, hierarchy of updates), findings (selection of parsimonious updates, overfitting with full revision, simulation results on Type I error and MSE), and case studies presented in the paper. No numerical errors were found."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses key terms like 'closed testing procedure', 'recalibration-in-the-large', 'recalibration', and 'model revision'. While not explicitly defined in the summary, the context and the hierarchical ordering provided give a good understanding of their meaning and purpose within the procedure. The term 'overfitting' is also used appropriately."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The original prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is a bulleted list, not sentences, and it is far more extensive than 5 sentences."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the essential aspects of the paper: the proposed method, the different update options, the rationale, the results from the clinical examples, and the simulation study findings. It highlights the main contributions and conclusions."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All points in the summary are directly supported by the information presented in the research paper. No unsupported claims or fabrications were found."
  },
  "total_score": 49,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is highly comprehensive and factually accurate, effectively covering the paper's research question, methods, and findings. However, it fails completely in following the prompt's constraint of a 5-sentence summary, presenting instead a detailed bulleted list."
