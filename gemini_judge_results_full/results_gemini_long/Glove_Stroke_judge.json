{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly and directly states the research question in the first sentence: 'examining, in detail, the beneficial therapeutic impacts that can be achieved through the utilization of wearable robotic gloves, specifically in the context of enhancing the functional capabilities of the hands in individuals who have experienced a stroke.'"
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reports the number of articles screened (2,674) and the number of included studies (5). It also correctly states that the methodological quality was moderate and that the studies found a positive therapeutic effect. The limitations mentioned (sample size, lack of control group, varied protocols) are also accurately reflected from the paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is very well-written and easy to understand. It avoids overly technical jargon. Terms like 'therapeutic impacts,' 'functional capabilities,' 'inclusion criteria,' and 'methodological quality' are used in a context that makes their meaning clear without explicit definitions. The flow of information is logical and coherent."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt specifically asked for a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is significantly longer, spanning four paragraphs and likely containing more than 20 sentences."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core findings: the aim of the review, the number of studies included, the main conclusion (positive therapeutic effect), the identified limitations (sample size, control groups, varied methods), and the call for future research with larger sample sizes and standardized methods. These are the most crucial take-home messages from the paper."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the research paper. There are no claims made that are not present in the original document."
  },
  "total_score": 50,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is excellent in terms of its clarity, factual accuracy, and coverage of the paper's key points. However, it completely failed to adhere to the sentence limit requested in the prompt, making it unsuitable as a direct response to that specific instruction."
