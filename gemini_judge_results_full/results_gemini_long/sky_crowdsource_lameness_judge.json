  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the research question of investigating a crowdsourcing approach for assessing lameness in dairy cattle, focusing on its feasibility and agreement with expert opinions."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the core findings, including the use of crowdsourcing via MTurk, the video comparison method, the agreement with experts, and the low number of workers needed. However, it misses the specific ICC values for agreement and the detail about the 'wisdom of the crowd' principle, which are key numerical results and concepts in the paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary explains key terms like 'crowdsourcing,' 'Amazon Mechanical Turk,' and the comparative assessment method clearly. The narrative flows well and is easy to understand for someone unfamiliar with the topic."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary provided is significantly longer than the requested 5 sentences. It comprises multiple paragraphs and a substantial amount of text, failing to adhere to the sentence count constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the main aspects of the study, including the method, participants, results (agreement, number of workers), and implications for training AI. It successfully conveys the novelty and potential of the approach. However, it could have been more complete by including the specific agreement metrics (ICC values) and explicitly mentioning the 'wisdom of the crowd' concept which is a key underpinning idea."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the original research paper. No fabricated information or claims outside the scope of the paper were found."
  },
  "total_score": 45,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary effectively captures the essence of the research, explaining the crowdsourcing methodology and its promising results in assessing dairy cattle lameness. However, it significantly fails to follow the prompt's sentence limit, providing a summary that is far too lengthy."
