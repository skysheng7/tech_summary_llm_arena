  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the central research question: how generative AI models, specifically DALL-E 3, represent livestock farming and the role of prompt revision in this representation. It highlights the bias towards romanticized, pastoral imagery and the erasure of intensive farming realities."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the core findings of the paper, including the default romanticized pastoral imagery, the impact of prompt revision in creating this bias, the capability of the base model to generate realistic depictions when revision is disabled, and the implications of this misinformation."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'generative artificial intelligence,' 'DALL-E 3,' 'prompt revision,' 'pastoral imagery,' and 'intensive farming practices.' While these are central to the paper, they are explained within the context of the summary. The term 'coded gaze' from the original paper is not included, which is understandable for a brief summary. The coherence is good, flowing logically from the problem to the findings and implications."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The original prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is significantly longer, consisting of five paragraphs, which is many more sentences than requested. This demonstrates a complete failure to follow the sentence limit constraint."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most important aspects: the problem (biased AI representations of livestock farming), the mechanism (prompt revision in DALL-E 3), the findings (romanticized vs. realistic depictions), the implications (misinformation, hindered dialogue), and the proposed solutions (transparency, disclosure). However, it is very detailed, which is not ideal for a concise 5-sentence summary. It also omits some nuances like regional variations or specific examples of prompt revision in different regions."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the information presented in the original research paper. No fabricated information or unsupported claims were found."
  },
  "total_score": 44,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is highly informative and accurately reflects the core findings and implications of the research paper regarding AI bias in livestock farming imagery. However, it significantly fails to adhere to the sentence limit requested in the prompt, making it too verbose for the desired output."
