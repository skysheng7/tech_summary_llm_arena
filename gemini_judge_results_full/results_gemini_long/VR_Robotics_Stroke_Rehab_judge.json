  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the research question, which is to investigate the efficacy of virtual reality (VR)-based robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation in stroke patients with hemiplegia."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings of the study, including the statistically significant improvements in lower limb motor function, balance, walking ability, activities of daily living, and quality of life for the intervention group. It also correctly notes the lack of significant improvement in global cognitive function."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is easy to understand. It explains 'hemiplegia' and 'activities of daily living (ADLs)' and uses clear language throughout."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary, but the provided summary is significantly longer, spanning multiple paragraphs. It does not adhere to the requested sentence count."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the most crucial aspects of the study: the research question, the intervention, the key positive findings (motor function, balance, ADLs, quality of life), the non-significant finding (cognitive function), and the conclusion about the promise of the intervention and need for further research."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the original research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 50,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is comprehensive and factually accurate, clearly explaining the study's research question, methods, results, and conclusions. However, it fails to adhere to the prompt's constraint of providing a 5-sentence summary, significantly exceeding the requested length."
