{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research problem: detecting community structure in large networks efficiently and accurately."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All stated facts, such as computational time (152 minutes for 118 million nodes), network sizes (2.6 million users, 118 million nodes), and comparison with other methods, are accurately reflected in the paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses key terms like 'community structure', 'modularity optimization', 'heuristic algorithm', and 'hierarchical structure' appropriately. While 'modularity' itself isn't deeply explained, its use in the context of optimization and its contribution to the algorithm's quality are clear."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is precisely 5 sentences long, directly adhering to the prompt's requirement."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the paper's main contributions: the novel algorithm, its speed and accuracy, the hierarchical nature, and a key application example (Belgian mobile phone network)."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 60,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that precisely follows the prompt. It accurately captures the core research question, the algorithm's methodology, its key advantages (speed and accuracy), and its practical application, all within the requested sentence limit."
