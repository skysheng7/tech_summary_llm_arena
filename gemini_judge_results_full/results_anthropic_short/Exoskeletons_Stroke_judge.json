  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the core research question of the paper: to review and categorize studies on exoskeleton-based rehabilitation combined with VR, AR, or gamification for stroke patients and assess their effectiveness."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key numerical data presented in the paper, such as the number of studies reviewed (30), the publication years (2010-2017), the total number of participants (approx. 385), the breakdown of limb focus (28 upper limb, 2 lower limb), the popularity of specific devices (ARMin, Bi-Manu Track, ArmeoSpring), and the number of studies using VR/gamification (15 each). It also correctly identifies the number of studies in clinic vs. home settings."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses key technical terms like VR, AR, and gamification, which are central to the paper's topic and are generally understood in this context. It also mentions specific exoskeleton devices and assessment findings without needing explicit explanations for a specialized audience. The overall coherence is good."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary, and the provided summary contains exactly 5 sentences."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the most important aspects of the paper: the scope of the review, the main findings regarding limb focus and popular devices, the general outcome of improved motor function and motivation, the identified gap in home-based rehabilitation, and the future research directions. It covers the key takeaways comprehensively."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the information presented in the original research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 58,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent, accurately reflecting the research question, methods, key findings, and conclusions of the original paper within the requested sentence limit. It is factually precise, coherent, and covers the most relevant information, making it a high-quality representation of the study."
