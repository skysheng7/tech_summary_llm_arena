{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not identify or attempt to answer any research question. Instead, it states that the provided text cannot be summarized."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately states that the provided text is a compilation of citations, hyperlinks, and references, rather than a unified document, and therefore cannot be summarized."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses straightforward language and avoids technical jargon. The coherence is high because it directly addresses the user's inability to summarize the provided text."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary of the article. The provided summary explicitly states that it cannot provide a 5-sentence summary."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The summary does not summarize the article at all, as it claims it cannot. Therefore, it is neither complete nor relevant to the content of the article."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements in the summary are directly supported by the nature of the provided text (a list of references/citations)."
  },
  "total_score": 30,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary correctly identifies that the provided text is not a cohesive article and therefore cannot be summarized as requested. However, it completely fails to follow the prompt's instruction to provide a 5-sentence summary, instead explaining why it cannot."
