{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the central research question: how OpenAI's DALL-E 3 text-to-image AI model handles the reality of intensive livestock farming, particularly through its prompt revision process, and what biases emerge."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the key findings of the paper, including the default generation of pastoral imagery, the impact of prompt revision, the shift to realistic indoor depictions when revision is disabled, regional variations, and the connection to actual housing statistics."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'prompt revision,' 'pastoral scenes,' and 'intensive conditions' appropriately. It explains the 'coded gaze' bias by connecting it to concealing realities and spreading misinformation, making it coherent. The term 'red teaming' is not used in the summary, avoiding potential confusion."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is precisely 5 sentences long, as requested by the prompt."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the most critical findings: the AI's tendency to romanticize farming, the role of prompt revision in this bias, the contrast with reality when revision is disabled, the emerging regional accuracy, and the broader implications for public discourse and misinformation."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent, accurately and concisely capturing the core findings and implications of the research paper within the requested sentence limit. It effectively explains the central problem of AI's prompt revision process erasing the reality of intensive livestock farming and presents the study's key discoveries regarding bias, realistic depictions, and societal impact."
