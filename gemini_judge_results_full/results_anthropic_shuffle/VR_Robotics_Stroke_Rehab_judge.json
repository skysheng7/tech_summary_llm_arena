  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the research question by stating the study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of VR-based robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation in stroke patients with hemiplegia."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical results (e.g., group sizes, mean differences for motor function) and findings (e.g., improvements in balance, walking ability, ADL, QoL, lack of cognitive improvement, no adverse events) are accurately reflected from the paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses appropriate terminology (e.g., VR-based robotic training, hemiplegia, conventional rehabilitation) without requiring extensive explanation, and the language is clear and coherent."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary consists of exactly 5 sentences as requested by the prompt."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the key aspects: the study design, the intervention and control groups, the main findings (positive effects on motor function, balance, ADL, QoL, lack of cognitive effect), the safety/feasibility, and the call for further research."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the information presented in the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 60,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that accurately and concisely captures the essence of the research paper. It effectively follows the prompt's instructions, presents factual information, and highlights the key findings and implications of the study."
