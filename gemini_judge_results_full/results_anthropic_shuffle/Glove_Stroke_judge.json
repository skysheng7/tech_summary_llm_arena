  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the research question by stating that the systematic review examines the therapeutic effects of wearable robotic gloves on hand function improvement in stroke patients."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical data and facts presented in the summary (e.g., number of databases searched, number of studies included, duration of intervention, sample size range, quality score range) are accurately reflected from the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses clear and understandable language. While it mentions specific device names and acronyms (EPHO, PneuGlove, X-Glove, HiM, IronHand), these are presented in a list and their collective purpose (robotic gloves for intervention) is clear from the context. The mention of 'randomized controlled trials' and 'spasticity' are common terms in this field and are used appropriately."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is exactly 5 sentences long."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively covers the most critical aspects of the paper: the research objective, methodology (search process, number of studies), key findings (positive effects, limitations like sample size and study design), and the main conclusion/recommendation for future research."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the original research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 60,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent, precisely following the prompt's sentence count and accurately capturing the core findings and conclusions of the research paper. It effectively highlights the study's objectives, methods, key results, and limitations, providing a comprehensive overview within the requested format."
