{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the main research question, which is to review and synthesize evidence on VR, AR, and gamification integrated with exoskeletons for stroke rehabilitation, focusing on efficacy and engagement."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the findings regarding positive outcomes in motor function and patient engagement, as well as the limitations of small sample sizes and varied outcome measures. No specific numerical inaccuracies were found."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "Key terms like VR, AR, and gamification are used in context. The summary is coherent and easy to understand, though it is more of a descriptive summary than a strict sentence-by-sentence breakdown of the paper's core findings."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The original prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is significantly longer and more detailed, structured as a multi-paragraph essay. It does not follow the sentence count constraint at all."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core objectives, key findings (positive outcomes in motor function and engagement), limitations (small sample sizes, varied measures), and conclusions (promising potential, need for more research) of the paper effectively."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements in the summary are directly supported by the content of the original paper."
  },
  "total_score": 46,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is comprehensive and accurately reflects the paper's content, objectives, findings, and limitations. However, it completely fails to adhere to the prompt's specific requirement of a 5-sentence summary, instead providing a much longer, multi-paragraph response."
