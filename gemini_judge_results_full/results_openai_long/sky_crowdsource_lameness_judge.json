  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly identifies the core research question: to investigate a novel, remote, comparison-based method for assessing dairy cow lameness using crowd workers and to determine its reliability and efficiency compared to experienced assessors."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical values, such as the number of crowd workers (50 per HIT, 10 needed for good agreement), number of video pairs (90), number of HIT (11), number of experts (5), ICC ranges (0.46-0.77 for crowd, 0.87 for experts, 0.89-0.91 for crowd average vs. expert average), and time per HIT (10 min), are accurately reported from the paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary explains 'remote' and 'comparison-based' assessments clearly. It also explains the scoring scale (-3 to +3) and the function of ICC. The flow is logical and easy to follow, with clear transitions between points."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt specifically asked for a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is significantly longer, exceeding 25 sentences. The preamble \"Here's a rewritten summary that restates ideas and adds redundant explanations, without introducing new facts:\" is also not part of the requested output."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers all the essential aspects of the paper: the method (remote, comparison-based, video, crowd workers), the recruitment and task design, the comparison with experts, the results (agreement levels, effect of worker number, filtering/clustering), and the overall conclusion about cost-effectiveness and utility for training AI models. The key takeaway about needing only ~10 workers for high agreement is well-emphasized."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the provided research paper. There are no claims made that are not present in the original text."
  },
  "total_score": 50,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is exceptionally comprehensive and factually accurate, covering all the critical findings and methods of the paper with excellent clarity. However, it completely fails to adhere to the prompt's strict sentence limit, making it unsuitable as a direct response to the original request."
