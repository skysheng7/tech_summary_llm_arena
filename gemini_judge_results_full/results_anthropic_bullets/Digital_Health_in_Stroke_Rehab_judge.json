{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 7,
    "reasoning": "The summary implicitly addresses the research question by outlining the 'how DHTs are used', 'key gaps', and 'how findings can inform' aspects through its bullet points on study focus, technologies, outcomes, facilitators, barriers, and future recommendations. However, it does not explicitly state the research questions as posed in the introduction of the paper."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical data presented in the summary (e.g., 14 studies, 85.71% upper extremity, 64.3% chronic phase, 50% home settings) are accurately reflected from the abstract and results section of the paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'DHTs', 'scoping review', 'RCTs', and specific technologies (VR, telerehabilitation) without explicit definitions. However, given the context of a research paper summary, these are likely understood by the target audience. The bullet-point format makes it coherent and easy to follow."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The original prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is in a bullet-point format and contains far more than 5 distinct pieces of information, effectively acting as a detailed outline rather than a concise summary."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the most important aspects of the paper, including the study's scope, key findings regarding technology use, effectiveness, facilitators, barriers, identified gaps, and future recommendations. It provides a comprehensive overview of the paper's contributions."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the original paper, as presented in the abstract, results, and conclusion sections."
  },
  "total_score": 45,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is highly accurate, comprehensive, and relevant to the paper's content, effectively covering all key takeaways. However, it completely failed to follow the prompt's instruction for a 5-sentence summary, instead providing a detailed bulleted outline."
