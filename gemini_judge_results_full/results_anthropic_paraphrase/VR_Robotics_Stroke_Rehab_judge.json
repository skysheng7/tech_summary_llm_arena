{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly states the study's objective: 'to assess the efficacy of virtual reality (VR)-enabled robotic training for lower limb recovery in 42 stroke survivors experiencing hemiplegia'."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical values (e.g., 42 participants, 20 per group, 6.5 vs 3.3 mean difference) and general findings are accurately reported as presented in the paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is well-written and easy to understand. Key terms like 'virtual reality (VR)-enabled robotic training' and 'hemiplegia' are presented in context and do not require further explanation for the intended audience of a research summary."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt asked for a 5-sentence summary. Paraphrase 1 has 6 sentences, Paraphrase 2 has 6 sentences, and Paraphrase 3 has 6 sentences. Therefore, none of the provided paraphrases followed the prompt."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively covers the main aspects of the study: the objective, methodology (intervention vs control, duration), key findings (motor function, balance, daily living, quality of life, and lack of cognitive improvement), safety, and the conclusion regarding future research needs."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements in the summary are directly supported by the information presented in the original paper. No unsupported claims are made."
  },
  "total_score": 50,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary excels in accurately capturing the research question, factual details, and overall completeness and relevance of the study's findings. However, it fails to adhere to the specific sentence count requested in the prompt, delivering 6 sentences instead of the requested 5."
