{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 7,
    "reasoning": "The summary touches on the research questions by discussing the focus of the studies (UE, chronic phase, home settings), the types of technologies used, and the findings on feasibility and effectiveness. However, it doesn't explicitly state the research questions as listed in the introduction of the paper."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the numerical data presented in the abstract and results section regarding the percentage of studies focusing on UE function, chronic phase, and home settings. It also correctly lists the types of technologies discussed."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'Digital Health Technologies (DHTs)', 'scoping review', 'upper extremity rehabilitation', 'chronic phase', 'telerehabilitation', and 'randomized controlled trials'. While some of these are common in the field, a more explicit definition of DHTs or a brief explanation of a scoping review might have been beneficial for a broader audience. However, the overall coherence and flow are good."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. All three provided options significantly exceed this limit (Option 1: 10 sentences, Option 2: 10 sentences, Option 3: 5 sentences but incomplete)."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the key findings of the review, including the focus of the research, the types of technologies, their effectiveness, facilitators, barriers, and identified gaps. It also includes the recommendations for future research, which are crucial takeaways. Option 3 is incomplete, but Options 1 and 2 are comprehensive."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summaries are directly supported by the content of the original research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 44,
  "overall_assessment": "The summaries are highly comprehensive and factually accurate, effectively capturing the main findings and recommendations of the research paper. However, they significantly fail to adhere to the prompt's request for a 5-sentence summary, with the provided options being much longer."
