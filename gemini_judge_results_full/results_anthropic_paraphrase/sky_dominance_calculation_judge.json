  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly states the research aim in the first sentence: 'to understand how the social pecking order shifts in response to different levels of competition at feeding sites, as quantified by feeder usage.'"
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reports the key numerical findings, including the decrease in hierarchy steepness (2.41 × 10⁻³ for every 1% surge), the increase in bidirectional exchanges (0.13% for every 1% rise), and the observation of dominant individuals losing more interactions in 7.57% of pairings."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'social pecking order,' 'dominance structure,' 'hierarchy's steepness,' and 'bidirectional exchanges' in a coherent manner. The concept of 'feeder occupancy' is introduced and linked to competition, making the explanation easy to follow without requiring external knowledge."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is precisely 5 sentences long, adhering strictly to the prompt's instructions."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the main findings and conclusions: the flattening of the hierarchy under competition, the increase in 2-way dyads, the proposed explanation (resource valuation over intrinsic traits), and the recommendation for future hierarchy studies. It covers the most important take-home messages."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements in the summary are directly supported by the content of the provided research paper. No unsupported claims or fabrications were found."
  },
  "total_score": 60,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary is excellent, accurately reflecting the study's research question, findings, and conclusions within the requested sentence limit. It is factually accurate, well-written, and clearly conveys the significance of the research."
