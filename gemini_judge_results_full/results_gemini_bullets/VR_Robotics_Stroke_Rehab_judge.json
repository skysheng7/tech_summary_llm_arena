{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the central research question: to investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of VR-based robotic training for lower limb rehabilitation in stroke patients with hemiplegia."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All presented results, including the significant improvements in motor function, balance, walking ability, ADLs, and quality of life, as well as the non-significant improvement in cognitive function, are factually accurate according to the paper. The conclusions about feasibility and the need for further research are also correctly represented."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses clear and understandable language. Key terms like 'VR-based robotic training,' 'hemiplegia,' and 'lower limb motor function' are used in a context that makes their meaning clear without requiring explicit definitions within the summary itself."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary, but the provided summary is presented as 10 bullet points, which is significantly more than the requested sentence count. Even if each bullet point were considered a 'sentence', it would still exceed the limit."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the main findings, including the positive impacts on motor function, ADLs, and quality of life, and the lack of effect on cognitive function. However, it elaborates on several points individually (e.g., separate bullets for balance, walking ability, ADLs, quality of life) which could have been consolidated to better fit within a 5-sentence limit and more closely align with the prompt's constraint. The feasibility aspect is mentioned but not as prominently as the effectiveness findings."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the information presented in the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 45,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary accurately reflects the study's findings and conclusions regarding the effectiveness and feasibility of VR-based robotic training. However, it fails to adhere to the prompt's strict sentence limit, presenting the information in an expanded bulleted list instead of a concise 5-sentence summary."
