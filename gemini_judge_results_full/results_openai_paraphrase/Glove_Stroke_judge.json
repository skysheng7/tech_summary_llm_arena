  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the research question: 'investigated the impact of wearable robotic gloves on hand function restoration for stroke survivors.'"
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All numerical data and factual statements presented in the summary, such as the number of initial entries (2674), the number of included studies (5), the range of participants (3-13), the duration of intervention (4-6 weeks), and the quality assessment score (7-10 out of 12), are accurately reflected in the original paper."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is well-written and easy to understand. While it uses some technical terms (e.g., 'subacute', 'spasticity', 'RCTs', 'Downs and Black checklist'), these are either common in the context of medical research or their meaning is inferable from the surrounding text. The coherence is excellent."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The prompt requested a 5-sentence summary. The provided summary is significantly longer, divided into three paragraphs, and contains many more than 5 sentences."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the key aspects of the paper, including the research objective, methodology (search, inclusion criteria, quality assessment), findings (positive outcomes, specific devices), limitations (small sample size, lack of RCTs, no control groups, spasticity detail), and the main conclusion/recommendation for future research. It covers the most important take-home messages."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the original paper. There are no unsupported claims or fabrications."
  },
  "total_score": 55,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is highly accurate, relevant, and comprehensive in its content, effectively conveying the core findings and limitations of the research. However, it significantly deviates from the prompt's instruction to provide a 5-sentence summary, delivering a much longer text."
