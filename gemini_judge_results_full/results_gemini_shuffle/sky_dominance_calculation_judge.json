  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly states the central research question: 'This study investigated how competition levels affect dominance hierarchies in dairy cows.'"
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All factual claims, including the relationship between feeder occupancy and hierarchy flattening, the increase in '2-way dyads', and the influence of resource valuation, are directly supported by the paper's findings."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "Key terms like 'dominance hierarchy,' 'feeder occupancy,' and '2-way dyads' are used appropriately. While '2-way dyads' is not explicitly defined, its meaning is inferable from the context of sentence 3. The flow of ideas is logical and easy to follow."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary contains exactly 5 sentences as requested by the prompt."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the main findings: the inverse relationship between competition and hierarchy steepness, the mechanism (increased success of subordinates, more 2-way dyads), the proposed reason (resource valuation over intrinsic attributes), and the key recommendation (context matters)."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 59,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that perfectly follows the prompt's instructions and accurately captures the core findings and implications of the research paper. It clearly articulates the research question, presents the key results logically, and offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of the study's conclusions."
