  "research_question": {
    "score": 9,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly articulates the main research goal: to propose and validate a novel method for dairy cow lameness assessment using a crowd-sourced lameness hierarchy."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects key findings such as the use of pairwise comparisons, crowd-sourcing, the 5-milestone subsampling algorithm, the need for a small number of workers and comparisons, high inter-observer reliability, and its feasibility for untrained workers. It also correctly mentions the comparison to traditional methods and potential for future applications."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'lameness hierarchy,' 'crowd-sourced data,' 'pairwise comparisons,' and '5-milestone subsampling algorithm.' While these are technical, their context within the summary makes them generally understandable. 'Inter-observer reliability' is a standard term, and its meaning is implied by the context of agreement between assessors."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, directly fulfilling the prompt's requirement."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary covers the core contributions: the novel method (hierarchy from crowd-sourced pairwise comparisons), its validation (reliability, feasibility), efficiency (subsampling), comparison to traditional methods, and future applications. These are the most important take-home messages."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements made in the summary are directly supported by the content of the research paper."
  },
  "total_score": 55,
  "overall_assessment": "This is an excellent summary that precisely follows the prompt's length requirement and accurately captures the paper's main contributions. It effectively communicates the novelty of the proposed lameness assessment method, its validation, efficiency, and potential applications, while maintaining factual accuracy."
