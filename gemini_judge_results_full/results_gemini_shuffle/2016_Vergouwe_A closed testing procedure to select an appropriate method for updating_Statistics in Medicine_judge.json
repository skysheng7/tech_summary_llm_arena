{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary clearly states the research question: to propose and evaluate a closed testing procedure for selecting an appropriate method to update previously developed prediction models for new populations."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All claims made in the summary are factually accurate and directly supported by the paper, including the mention of preventing overfitting, controlling Type I error, balancing updating needs with overfitting risks, and the use of three clinical examples."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses terms like 'closed testing procedure', 'prediction models', 'overfitting', 'Type I error', 'recalibration in the large', and 'model revision'. While these are key terms from the paper, they are not explicitly explained within the summary itself. However, the context and flow make the overall meaning understandable, and the terms are essential to the paper's topic. A slightly higher score could be achieved with brief explanations of these terms."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary is exactly 5 sentences long, precisely following the prompt's instruction."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively captures the core contribution of the paper: the proposed closed testing procedure for updating prediction models. It highlights the procedure's purpose (preventing overfitting, ensuring reliability), methodology (systematic testing of updating methods), rationale (balancing updating needs vs. overfitting), and application (clinical examples)."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements in the summary are directly supported by the content of the research paper. No information is fabricated or misrepresented."
  },
  "total_score": 58,
  "overall_assessment": "This summary excels at following the prompt and accurately capturing the paper's main contribution and methodology. It effectively communicates the purpose and benefits of the proposed closed testing procedure for updating prediction models, making it highly relevant and complete."
