{
  "research_question": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately identifies the core research question of the paper, which is to systematically review the use of exoskeletons with VR, AR, and gamification for stroke rehabilitation."
  },
  "factual_accuracy": {
    "score": 8,
    "reasoning": "The summary accurately reflects the general findings and conclusions of the paper. It mentions positive outcomes, limitations such as small sample sizes, and the need for further research. However, it does not include specific quantitative results or precise details about the effectiveness as presented in the paper (e.g., specific percentages of improvement or specific outcome measures used)."
  },
  "terminology_explanation_and_coherence": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary uses key terms like 'exoskeletons', 'virtual reality (VR)', 'augmented reality (AR)', and 'gamification' appropriately within the context of stroke rehabilitation. The bullet points make the summary coherent and easy to understand, and the terms are standard in the field without requiring explicit explanation for this audience."
  },
  "prompt_following": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "The original prompt requested a summary in 5 sentences. The provided summary is in bullet points, not sentences, and contains 5 bullet points. Therefore, it did not follow the sentence format requested."
  },
  "completeness_and_relevance": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The summary effectively covers the main aspects of the paper: the scope of the review (exoskeletons with VR/AR/gamification for stroke rehab), the aims (summarize evidence on effectiveness), key findings (positive outcomes, improved engagement), limitations (sample size, follow-up), and the overall conclusion (potential benefits and need for more research). These are the most important take-home messages."
  },
  "hallucination": {
    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "All statements in the summary are directly supported by the content of the original paper. It accurately reflects the review's scope, findings, and limitations."
  },
  "total_score": 48,
  "overall_assessment": "The summary is comprehensive and accurately reflects the core findings and implications of the research paper. Its main weakness is its failure to adhere to the requested sentence format, instead presenting the information in bullet points."
